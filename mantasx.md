tooling I'm missing

   okay

   so you can get the user's email address on the page
   and then you can confirm it
   can we turn an email address into a substack id / username?


   we need to be able to verify that the person predicting who *say* they own the substack profile
   actually owns it
   we could just link the logged in person
   with a mantax id forever more
   and track when people discover?


   1. person predicts
      - provides email
   2. if no mantax cookie
      3. "what is your email address"? enter email address (or glom from site)
         4. email sets cookie

   oh! we could inject a button on scott's dashboard, which would have access to
   the subscriber list and can verify the link between each subscribers
   email and substack id

   post /prediction
      - user id
      - email
      - subscription id
      - stripe user id


   "here is my subscription id, which is not public"

   - we can then verify that on scott's end


   okay

   so you could wait for the page to load

   and then be like
      - see what the ban looks like

      - add a button to each comment
         - predict "scott will ban this"

      - operations
         - make prediction

         - get user scores to display next to name
            - cache a json object of users and scores for the article

            - we need something to support the batch retrival of many scores given a set of keys

            - and then any comments that have been added in the mean time get requested and added to the cache

            - given the users on the page
            - give back all user scores
            - (might have to fire as users are loaded in)
         
         - get predictions for this user (so as to color)

         - update scores (cron)
            - could 

      - that prediction then goes into a db
         - postgrest?
         - cloud flare worker KV?

         - whatever has the most generous free tier?
         - whatever can be bundled with compute to calculate the new bans?
         - you'll want caching on the calls to get the predictions

      - and needs to be reconciled whenver scott does ban something

      - needs to display that persons record


      - each person who predicts needs to be put in the db, and a record of their predictions tracked over time


      - each person starts with 100 credits and can fund bets they like

      - if they get below 10 they get topped up at the end of every week?
