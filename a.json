I'm curious why you have a passionate aversion to a one-time dose of mRNA but you're quite happy dosing yourself dozens, if not a hundred or more times, with another unnatural chemical.  I can totally understand Vitamind D and zinc, as you eat those things all the  time, but ivermectin isn't a normal part of the human (or any animal) diet.  It's not a natural compound at all, it's synthesized by bacteria and its primary effect is to kill insects and worms by frying their nerves.\n\nIt could screw up your nerves, too, if you get too much of it, and it's not even implausible  that it could cause some very minor nerve or  brain damage at moderate doses taken long enough.  A recent survey of potential side effects:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8087035/\n\nNobody knows or sure what might happen with long-term moderate use, because the normal treatment for worms is a short dose, and anyway the chance of some very minor neurological side effects would be totally acceptable  if your other option is river blindness, so nobody has looked for this.   But it seems like an odd risk to willingly run the clinical trial on yourself if you're otherwise in perfect health.",

Also do you have criticisms of the study I posted? My experience as a critical care doctor surrounded by these patients 24/7 in the early days of the pandemic was that, once everyone (patients and healthcare providers) was universally masking infections went down dramatically  (among healthcare workers at least) despite very consistent exposures (I know this for a fact because we were tracking Ct values in patients early on so had a sense for how high a burden of virus they were carrying in their nose). I‚Äôm not familiar with the 2015 case but unless it was about a different highly contagious virus that spread via aerosols it‚Äôs not immediately clear to me that it‚Äôs relevant to the COVID pandemic.",

I care about all people regardless of what they contribute to society. \nNothing seems to work against stopping the spread. These spikes in Germany (z.B) look an awful lot like the spikes last year before mandatory KN95 and high vax. \nI'm of the belief that there is something important about this that we don't understand. How for example are deer getting COVID? They don't ever go in indoor public spaces or gather in crowds of people. Ethical Skeptic has an interesting theory that it's spread by aerosolized fecal particles taken from wastewater and used as fertilizer.",

                                                                                            "body": "> First, you could reach significance by having a strong result with a minority of mask types.\n\nIt is true that it is possible that a minority of competent mask wearers could be distorting the data - imagine that, say, masks actually are REALLY effective against COVID, and actually lower transmission by 80%, but poorly fitted masks are useless.\n\nIf half the people were wearing masks properly, and half improperly, it would look like masks were lowering infections by just shy of half, when in reality, they were actually twice that effective.\n\nBut... a lot of the original studies done for non-COVID viruses were done by giving people surgical masks, and indeed, some of the cruise ships simply handed out surgical masks, and yet that still seemed to cut infections and/or severity of infection. Those masks only marginally filter air as far as I can tell, especially the way that most people wear them (i.e. badly).\n\n> I also suspect the results are different for mask-effectiveness for the mask-wearer (for which I think the masks that don't filter air may be useless), and for the person exposed to the mask wearer (who is at least not being coughed on directly with high-velocity spit).\n\nI mean, this is certainly possibly part of it.\n\nNot only do masks block coughs but they also probably lower moist airborne particles breathed out that just float around in the air. You also aren't directly breathing on other people, so the particles float around longer in the air, which probably causes more of them to die before they reach anyone else.\n\nSo that could partially explain things like this, which found that people in areas with lots of masking got less sick, which seems to be the case from various events like the cruise ships, where we tested literally everyone and so actually know how many people got infected:\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-020-06067-8\n\nAnd a recent meta study seems to reinforce the notion that masks are associated with lower risk, which, again, could be because of this:\n\nhttps://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj-2021-068302\n\nThat said, while it's possible that masks merely protect people who are around masked people... people who wear masks seem to be less likely to get sick.\n\nThere is evidence that people who wear masks are less likely to have contracted COVID, and that less frequent masking seems to be associated with higher COVID rates.\n\nAxios did some surveys about this: https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-masks-fewer-positive-tests-87a97b0f-6d30-4440-a16f-ef73bb859c2b.html\n\nAnd their results were exactly what we'd expect if masks did help, and seem to suggest that always wearing a mask reduces your risk by 50%.\n\nNow it's possible this is just some sort of confounding effect - say, people who wear masks are also more diligent in other ways that are protecting them from the virus, or are simply less willing to go out at all, and thus expose themselves to less.\n\nBut there are a number of plausible mechanisms.\n\nOne is that, while a lot of air is coming in around them, some IS coming through the filter, and that helps.\n\nA second is that the air is being pulled in an indirect path, that might remove some of the moisture or whatever.\n\nA third is that the masks stop other people from breathing on YOU directly - thus, getting their gross COVID germs all over you, getting sucked in directly, instead deflecting them. Even a mask that doesn't fit all that well will still have this effect.\n\nLikewise, someone sneezing or coughing can't get the moisture on your lips or nostrils either.\n\nAnd of course, there's always the possibility that wearing a mask simply stops you from touching your face with your dirty hands, and thus smearing germs all over your face.",

New case rates in rural areas were for a long time around 1% of new case rates in big cities. AFAIK none of the models accounted for this.\n\n- The graphs don't show infection rate, because nobody has that data. We have new cases detected, which is an underestimate of infection rate if everyone with symptoms is tested, and is more of an underestimate, but also proportional to the number of people tested, if people are tested randomly. Without knowing the criteria used to distribute tests at each testing center--which we didn't know for the crucial initial few months--we could use the number of new cases as a lower bound on number of cases, but *not* to estimate infection rate or prevalence in the population.\n\n- I ran a test on the national data sometime in May and showed that the number of tests that had been distributed on each day accounted for, IIRC, about 98% of the variation in the number of cases detected that day, meaning those scary \"number of new covid cases\" graphs were just showing you how many tests had been distributed.\n\n- Hospitals and nursing homes were financially incentivized to over-report cases.\n\n- The death counts would be a better number, except that the CDC adopted the standard of counting \"covid-related deaths\" (a person died and then tested positive for covid) instead of covid-caused deaths.\n\n- Maybe we can count excess deaths, although some of these will be due to people not getting medical attention for other problems.\n\n- The number of intensive care unit beds occupied by covid cases could have been good data, but there are 1 or 2 serious inconsistencies (impossibilities) in it at the national level that make large swaths of it useless\n\nThe only thing I could confidently deduce from the Feb-May data was that the first cases were in February IIRC, and it was already widespread by May 1 IIRC; and even if you did the math using the new-case data as a lower bound, you still got the very high infection rate claimed for it.

There have been studies that have been done showing the net benefit or collateral damage to such measures may bring into question that claim. That is, is the cure worse than the disease? I think it is. History generally shows this is a feature and not a bug. Of course, I tend to view this with this being a moral panic so it will skew or distort my perception. But there's ample literature filtering in showing it may be the case. Masks and social distancing will come with trade-offs. Likely psychological; maybe physical with the masks. We'll see. Lockdowns are just plain unethical, impractical, unjust and unscientific. These are more rooted in man's hubris thinking he can stop a virus. I'm a simple man. Mother Nature is better. ",

Of course, those studies were for influenza, but seeing that a coronavirus is smaller in size, it's logical to conclude the masks (ie breathing barriers - or dare I say amulets) are ineffective against it too. it's interesting to note actual PPE experts and industrial hygienists, at least the ones I've come across, don't think mass mask wearing do a thing. Not sure we should be conditioning people via mandates to wear them based on the evidence. ",

They have no basis in science, and in fact, are actively refuted by science.\n\nDesegregation in the US coincided with a massive *increase* in crime. If \"systemic racism\" and an absence of \"social justice\" cause crime, then why would outlawing systemic racism and increasing \"social justice\" cause crime to double? It's obvious nonsense.\n\nThe reality is that even the most casual reading of data refutes all of these beliefs. Poverty doesn't cause crime - it doesn't track demographically, nor societally, with crime rates varying independently of poverty rates, and events like the Great Depression and Great Recession not appearing to affect underlying crime trends.\n\nEducation sounds nice, but in real life, we have vastly increased the amount of education in the US since the early 1900s, but we saw similar massive crime waves in the 1910s-1930s and the 1970s-1990s. Interim crime rates were similar in the 1950s and the 2000s. If education lowered criminality, crime should have trended downwards throughout the 20th century. It has not.\n\nThe reality is that all of these things are just things that leftists want, that they claim will prevent crime. There is no evidence that any of them prevent crime, or indeed, have any effect on crime whatsoever.\n\n2) Genetics - Yes, most scientists in the field are left leaning. And... they pretty overwhelmingly believe that the black/white IQ gap is probably at least partially explained by genetic factors.\n\nBut there are other issues there as well. We know that criminality is about 50% heritable. We know that the propensity for addiction is about 50% heritable. We know that many factors that we think of as a matter of free will or individual choice are heavily influenced by genetic factors.\n\nThis all flies in the fact of leftist beliefs, because, as it turns out, the beliefs are false.\n\nAll men are created equal *before the law*, not *before the laws of nature*. Life isn't fair. If you rely on the idea that all men are secretly created equal to demand human rights, your beliefs are built on sand.\n\nI don't rely on that as a basis for my personal liberalism. I think that basic human rights are important because they benefit everyone.\n\n3) Economics. \"The left promotes less income and wealth inequality. You disagree?\"\n\nThe left's beliefs are based on 19th century antisemitic conspiracy theories that Jews are hoarding all the money and are controlling society through the banks, corporations, and the state, and that indeed, money is the God of Israel.\n\nRead Karl Marx's \"On The Jewish Question\" sometime. He sounds an awful lot like a Nazi because, shock and surprise, he was a raging antisemitic conspiracy theorist, and his beliefs about everything were an attempt to support his nutjobbery.\n\nIRL economics is primarily controlled by per capita productivity. Inequality is a completely worthless measure of anything of value - all it tells you is that some people produce much more value than others, which is objectively true. Indeed, it has zero predictive value.\n\nThe only way to make society better is to increase per capita productivity, as per capita productivity is what controls how much stuff society produces and thus, ultimately, how much it has.\n\nHanding out money - either by \"social spending\" like the COVID giveaways, or by cutting taxes - doesn't increase per capita productivity. All they ultimately do is devalue money - which is why we have seen such high inflation rates amongst capital assets and more recently consumer goods, when taxes were cut and money was given away even as productivity fell.\n\nInflation is caused by these factors because money is a medium of exchange. The only way to make society wealthier is to have society produce more value as a whole.\n\nCapitalism works because it rewards efficiency - people who produce more value for society get paid more money for their goods and services, which in turn produces even more value for society.\n\nThis is why capitalism works and why socialism does not.\n\n5) Epidemiology?\n\nYou seem to have already forgotten all the people who claimed that going out on those Russian propaganda inspired BLM marches in the middle of the pandemic was okay, or how restricting international travel was \"racist\", or that fear of the Coronavirus was caused by \"xenophobia\" towards China, all of which was claimed by the leftist press early on in the pandemic.\n\n6) Gun research.\n\nGun ownership rates have no relationship to violent crime or criminal homicide rates. The reality is that all of the push for \"gun control\" is an attempt to scapegoat rural whites - who own the most guns - for issues with crime in inner city areas.",

While you are looking, look at incarceration rates and how the prison systems are run in countries with low crime rates.\nWithout looking up the statistics, I believe that after desegregation in 1954 crime did increase until around 2000 where it went back down to 1950's levels.\nCrime peaked in the 1970's and there is a correlation between the banning of leaded gasoline and the reduction ion crime.   Probably just a coincidence.\nI am pretty sure that any studies you have read linking race to criminality are BS.\nYou are right, life isn't fair.   There are greater differences between individuals than there are differences that are accounted for by being of different race on average.\nHilarious - the far right is currently re telling that same old anti-Semitic fable that hilter used to justify the holocaust, and now you say the left is using it to justify reducing income inequality?   How about you do some research into comparing the income inequality in other nations with quality of life.   \nIn the USA and Russia there are oligarchs that control a disproportionate amount of wealth.   Productivity makes the nation as a whole wealthier, which disproportionally ends up in the control of the wealthy class.   Everyone is better off if the wealth is distributed more evenly.\nYes Capitalism works because it rewards efficiency.   It fails when it exploits resources to the point of depletion.  It has to be constrained through regulation in areas where market forces do not force constraint.  \nI can only assume that what I watched and read about BLM is true and that their cause is just.   I have no direct experience with racial injustice in the USA.\nI disagreed with the calls from the left to caution against xenophobia and leave borders open.   Given the Chinese pandemic response,  All nations should have locked down first and asked questions later.\nYour 2nd amendment is broken.   It allows for almost unrestricted gun ownership without calling for any  responsibility.   Why is the phrase \"A well regulated Militia\" even there?   Does it have any meaning in how gun regulations are created or enforced?   \nI could live with Switzerland's gun culture.  Americans are deluded in the thinking that a good guy with a gun can stop a bad guy with a gun.    The truth is that a sad guy with a gun can kill himself with his own gun.",

Homicide rates only really started rising in the late 1960s, but rose very rapidly.\n\n> I am pretty sure that any studies you have read linking race to criminality are BS.\n\nI'm sorry, but the raw data exists.\n\nhttps://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-43\n\nYou can also look at NCVS data:\n\nhttps://bjs.ojp.gov/data-collection/ncvs\n\nCrime rates aren't the same across groups. At all. They are *vastly* higher amongst black people. Black people are more likely to be victims of crime, and there are a higher rate of criminals in black communities.\n\nThis is why poor black neighborhoods have a reputation for criminality, and why cities like Baltimore, St. Louis, New Orleans, and the like have sky-high homicide rates - in 2016, Chicago had more murders than the entire country of Canada.\n\nIndeed, over HALF of homicides and robberies in the US are committed by black criminals.\n\nAnd this applies to victims as well. Black people are vastly more likely to be VICTIMS of crime as well.\n\nOver half of homicide VITCIMS in the US are black.\n\nAnd most murderers - roughly 90% - kill someone from their own ethinic or racial group.\n\nYou would have to argue that the conspriacy involves not just all the police agencies in the US, but also the CDC, which counts homicide victims and reports that over half of homicide victims in the US are black. That they are making up a bunch of fake dead black people.\n\nBut they're not.\n\nNote also that the overall percentage of criminals who are black - about 28% - is very similar to the proportion of people who are shot by the police who are black according to police shooting databases.\n\nThis is not surprising in light of the studies that have found that, after controlling for circumstances, there's zero relationship between race and the likelihood of being shot.\n\nThe reality is that the driver of all of these differences is differences in basal crime rates.\n\nThis also almost certainly has a negative effect on black children in these communities, and if an environmental factor is responsible for disparities in academic achievement, this is probably the most likely one that is hard to account for that could be having a sharply disparate impact across exactly the lines you need. Indeed, if you look at national crime rate statistics, school performance tiers and crime rates per captia match up surprisingly well - blacks have the worst school achievement and the highest crime rates, Hispanics and Native Americans are middling, whites are above average in acheivement and below average in crime, and Asians have the lowest crime rate and the best rate of school achievement.\n\nMoreover, and quite conveniently, Japan and other far eastern countries have very low crime rates and do very well academically, as measured by tests like the PISA.\n\nThat said, there are problems with blaming everything on crime, the most obvious being that crime rates vary enormously from place to place, even within the same demographic groups. A black person in NYC in 2013 and a black person in St. Louis in 2013 experienced vastly different crime rates. And yet, we still see significant disparities in both NYC and St. Louis schoolchildren - if the cause was just crime, shouldn't the NYC schoolchild be doing much better by comparison? But there is still a very large racial gap there - in fact, the gap is quite similar.",

Beyond the fact that lead exposure in the levels we're talking about is way too small to have that kind of effect (it's a couple of IQ points), there's the much larger problem that people were exposed to tons of lead before the 1970s due to lead paint and pipes. Indeed, people in the 1950s almost certainly were exposed to more lead as childen than people in the 1970s and 1980s, and indeed, in the modern day, one of the largest risk factors for having high blood-lead levels as a child is having lead paint on the walls/other things in your house (as the lead dust gets everywhere).\n\nMoreover, lead is a cumulative toxin, so we would expect crime levels to gradually taper off over time. Instead they actually rose to a peak in 1994 before falling off rapidly. The profile is completely wrong.\n\n> There are greater differences between individuals than there are differences that are accounted for by being of different race on average.\n\nYes, you cannot judge an individual based on their race.\n\nThat doesn't mean that there aren't very large staistical differences between groups in aggregate, which means a lot of people will be worse off in one group than another.\n\n> Hilarious - the far right is currently re telling that same old anti-Semitic fable that hilter used to justify the holocaust, and now you say the left is using it to justify reducing income inequality?\n\nNo. The very premise is wrong and is based on antisemitism.\n\nThe entire belief system about \"income inequality\" is that it is because there's a conspiracy of rich Jews who are stealing all the money from the Gentiles.\n\nAs Karl Marx said in his antisemitic diatribe \"On The Jewish Question\":\n\n> \"Let us not look for the secret of the Jew in his religion, but let us look for the secret of his religion in the real Jew.\n\n> What is the secular basis of Judaism? Practical need, self-interest. What is the worldly religion of the Jew? Huckstering. What is his worldly God? Money.\n\n> Very well then! Emancipation from huckstering and money, consequently from practical, real Judaism, would be the self-emancipation of our time.\"\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/jewish-question/#:~:text=Let%20us%20not,of%20our%20time.\n\nOr we can look at \"The Russian Loan\", written in 1856 by Marx:\n\n> \"This loan is brought out under the auspices of the house of Stieglitz at St. Petersburg. Stieglitz is to Alexander what Rothschild is to Francis Joseph, what Fould is to Louis Napoleon. The late Czar Nicholas made Stieglitz a Russian Barron, as the late Kaiser Franz made old Rothschild an Austrian Baron, while Louis Napoleon has made a Cabinet Minister of Fould, with a free ticket to the Tuileries for the females of his family. Thus we find every tyrant backed by a Jews, as is every Pope by a Jesuit. In truth, the cravings of oppressors would be hopeless, and the practicability of war out of the question, if there were not an army of Jesuits to smother thought and a handful of Jews to ransack pockets.\"\n\nhttps://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030213/1856-01-04/ed-1/seq-4/\n\nYeah, Marx was a Rothschild conspiracy theorist.\n\nThe reason why socialist conspiracy theories about how everyone is getting robbed by some shadowy elite looks so similar to antisemitic conspriacy theories is because they literally are antisemitic conspriacy theories, just barely repackaged.\n\n> How about you do some research into comparing the income inequality in other nations with quality of life.\n\nThere's no relationship whatsoever, actually.\n\nAmericans enjoy a higher standard of living than almost anywhere else because they're simply so rich. It's absolute wealth, not relative wealth, that affects standard of living.\n\nYou will see some made up metrics that try to lower the US standard of living by adding in a factor for \"inequality\" because if you just use the metrics straight up, it makes Europe look bad apart from the Nordic countries, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Lichtenstein.\n\n> In the USA and Russia there are oligarchs that control a disproportionate amount of wealth. Productivity makes the nation as a whole wealthier, which disproportionally ends up in the control of the wealthy class. Everyone is better off if the wealth is distributed more evenly.\n\nExcept this is false. They aren't equivalent - not even remotely - and your religious belief about \"equality\" is false, because most wealth is in the form of corporations, not consumer goods.\n\nIndeed, trying to claim that the US is secretly the same as Russia is standard reverse cargo culting and is typical Russian propaganda.\n\nFunny how that works.\n\n> I can only assume that what I watched and read about BLM is true and that their cause is just.\n\nTurns out that the whole thing is fake. Studies have been done on this.\n\nhttp://www.nber.org/papers/w22399.pdf\n\nTurns out that once you control for circumstances, black people are no more likely to be shot under the same circumstances as white people are, and use of non-lethal force is only marginally more likley and varies by jurisdiction (i.e. the opposite of systemic).\n\nAnd guess who promotes this conspiracy theory, that the police are all evil and attacking black people unduly? If you guessed \"Russia\", you'd be right.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_and_Black_Lives_Matter\n\nYeah, turns out Russia promotes both pro and anti BLM stuff to undermine confidence in the police and divide Americans.\n\nI believe I mentioned something about everything you believe being a lie, didn't I?\n\nBecause, yeah.\n\n> Your 2nd amendment is broken. It allows for almost unrestricted gun ownership without calling for any responsibility. Why is the phrase \"A well regulated Militia\" even there? Does it have any meaning in how gun regulations are created or enforced?\n\nIt's in there because the US didn't originally have a standing army and everyone was expected to have a gun and go get called up to fight redcoats or Native Americans or whatever.\n\n> The truth is that a sad guy with a gun can kill himself with his own gun.\n\nThen why do so many people in South Korea and Japan - places without many guns - kill themselves?",

This is like many of the assertions that you are making.\nI am done talking about where the US is ranked in education, I just tried to look it up and found the \"2021 Best Countries Report\" ranks the US as #1,  while the \"2020 Global Citizens for Human Rights\" doesn't place the US in the top 10 for 2020.\n\nLocking up criminals should be viewed as a societal failure.   We have to ask why has the life of each of these individuals descended to a point to where it is deemed that the best course of action is to lock them up?  Are too many people being locked up unnecessarily or is there something wrong that is causing rates of crimes that lead to incarceration to be higher than in peer nations?\nOr are prisons about providing cheap labour and income opportunities for the beneficiaries' of the prison industrial complex?\nShall we talk about prisoners fighting wildfires in California?  It is bad enough that these men are compelled to do this difficult and dangerous work for little to no compensation,  they don't even get work experience credit that would allow them to continue that kind of work as a career upon their  release.\nYou seem to think that I see  \"systemic racism\" as some kind of conspiracy.   That is only a part of it:  Blacks were unable to  access benefits under the GI bill,  Redlining created ghetto's etc.   It also encompasses other more subtle factors.   With lower incomes, minorities have to spend more of their time and money commuting.   This leads lowers quality of life and lessens time for families to spend together as one example.\nYes Russia is sowing disinformation on both sides to undermine the west,  I have made that point elsewhere. \nThere is still a lot to be said about BLM being a just cause.  As an example: Can you justify how Crystal Mason has been treated under the law when there are a handful of more egregious voter fraud cases that ended up with little to no consequence to the offender.  She should never have been charged IMO.   \n  And perhaps I was being hyperbolic when I drew a parallel between Russian and American Billionaires.   \nI could make the argument that Jeff Bezos has created an incredibly efficient distribution system that is a benefit to the world.  At the same time, I wonder why he can't pay his people better now that the business is well established.\nUn-Restrained capitalism.\n\nNothing to say about Swiss gun culture?\nSince the lack of a standing army rational no longer applies, perhaps the 2nd amendment could use some revision.\n",

As easily as you can find a study concluding no correlation between race and use of police force, I can find multiple, even more recent publications concluding the opposite. The U.S. government doesn't even mandate reporting of lethal force (Byers & Moskop, 2014), so it's difficult to empirically investigate associated factors.\n\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550620916071\n\"Cesario et al. argue that benchmarking the relative counts of killings by police on relative crime rates, rather than relative population sizes, generates a measure of racial disparity in the use of lethal force that is unbiased by differential crime rates. Their publication, however, lacked any formal derivation showing that their benchmarking methodology has the statistical properties required to establish such a claim. We use the causal model of lethal force by police conditional on relative crime rates implicit in their analyses and prove that their benchmarking methodology does not, in general, remove the bias introduced by crime rate differences. Instead, it creates strong statistical biases that mask true racial disparities, especially in the killing of unarmed noncriminals by police. Reanalysis of their data using formally derived criminality-correcting benchmarks shows that there is strong and statistically reliable evidence of anti-Black racial disparities in the killing of unarmed Americans by police in 2015‚Äì2016.\"\n\nI think it's generally a good thing to be skeptical of mainstream worldviews, and I don't actually care whether or not your published statistical analysis is correct or mine is, but the fact is that the data is inconsistent, with conflicting statistics regularly published in both directions. And it's not even as if this is a rare phenomenon, do you know how common it is for conflicting research to be published in peer-reviewed journals?  You act as if pointing to a single publication proves anything, and then go on to cite Wikipedia. That fact alone gives insight into your \"everything you know is wrong\" mindset, but you're too caught up to realize that having any great level of certainty in a budding area of research with limited data is a fool's errand.\n\nTrying to write off the entirety of BLM as Russian propaganda is edgelord narcissism. That's synonymous to claiming the HK riots are entirely the result US or Western anti-china propaganda.  Even if there is an invisible hand at play positioned to benefit from the unrest, that doesn't make it the cause, and considering you have no data on how great a role foreign interference may have played, even mentioning it is a moot point.  If you really believe it's possible to create a nationwide movement of 25+ million people through facebook posts and social media bots alone, without some underlying substantiality, then there is no hope for you. If BLM leads to greater police accountability, then it will have succeeded in accomplishing something that serves to collectively benefit the population, regardless of foreign support for or against.",

Most people who claim to be \"Young Earth Creationists\" aren't.\n\nIt's a case of belief as attire.\n\nIf you ask people a bunch of religious questions and ask them some science questions, things that automatically trigger tribalistic responses, you get very badly distorted responses.\n\nIndeed, even in those polls, you'll find that the results are self-contradictory. For instance, in one poll, they asked:\n\nThe Bible describes the creation of life exactly as it occurred in six days (50%).\n\nHuman fossils have been found mixed in with dinosaur fossils showing that humans existed at the same time that dinosaurs existed (43%).\n\nGod created the universe, the earth, the sun, moon, stars, plants, animals, and the first two people within the past 10 000 years (39%).\n\nThere was a flood within the past 10 000 years that covered all of the earth and was responsible for most of the rock layers and fossils that are seen across the world (60%).\n\nBut then you start asking other questions, and, well...\n\nLayers of rock containing fossils cover the earth's surface and date back hundreds of millions of years (78%).\n\nHumans share reflexes with other primates that are not shared with other animals (75%).\n\nDinosaurs became extinct about 65 million years ago (69%).\n\nAll life forms are descended from common ancestors that developed over millions of years (65%).\n\nBirds appear to have evolved from dinosaurs (55%).\n\nAs you can see, these percentages are directly contradictory.\n\nIn real life, this is an example of priming - if you ask people religiously oriented questions (like about Adam and Eve), they will often answer with more \"religious\" answers.\n\nConversely, if you ask them a bunch of science questions, they are much more likely to give the correct answers.\n\nSadly, people who aren't familiar with surveys gullibly believe all sorts of nonsense because \"it was in a poll\".\n\nIRL, a lot of polls give complete garbage answers and you can dramatically alter people's answers by asking them different sets of questions and priming them in different ways.\n\nIt's not evidence for poor science education at all. Pretty much everyone in the US is taught about evolution and geology and all that stuff. The people who actively go into denial about it are a minority.",

You aren't actually measuring school quality at all - you're measuring student quality.\n\nOnly by controlling for these factors can you actually assess school quality - if a school for rich white and Asian kids is boosting performance by 5 points compared to other rich kids, and a school for poor black kids is boosting performance by 20 points compared to other poor black kids, the latter school is doing a better job of improving student performance than the former school, even though the former school has higher scores overall.\n\nIf you compare black children in the US to, say, aboriginal Australians, black children in the US do better than Aborginal Australians. But Aboriginal Australians make up only a bit more than 1% of Australia's population, compared to 12% of the US population being black. Thus, the fact that Aboriginal Australians do worse than black Americans changes the Australian average by less, even though the disadvantaged minority in the US is doing *better* than the equivalent in Australia.\n\nYou seem to be struggling with the basic notion of experimental controls.",

Strictly speaking, it probably *isn't* fair - Aboriginal Australians are probably more disadvantaged than black Americans are.\n\n> I would think comparing them to black students in the UK or France would be more apt. Are you cherry picking?\n\nNo. The actual reason is much simpler: they don't measure those stats, so those stats don't exist, so I can't compare them.\n\nBut not measuring something doesn't mean that the problem doesn't exist.\n\nWe do know from some other stats that they experience similar disparities in other areas to the US  - for instance, black people in the UK are a bit more than 3x as likely per capita to be arrested by the police as white people are, which is very similar to the US rate.\n\n> You could compare indigenous students with each other: US, Canada, Australia, NZ. But they are a small minority. None of these countries has a proud history of treading their indigenous people well.\n\nYou can do this, and you'll find that the Native Americans in the US and Canada and the Maori of New Zealand all do way better than the Aboriginal Australians.\n\nHere's something that includes data on the Maori on the PISA:\n\nhttps://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/196629/PISA-2018-NZ-Summary-Report.pdf\n\nThey scored about 463 - modestly worse than US Hispanics, but better than American blacks.",

And conservatives, by and large, do not subscribe to this idea of prevalent systemic racism in the US. So, there goes this excuse. \n\nStatistical - yes. Some minorities tend to be poorer for historical reasons, and that has all kinds of consequences.  But systemic - no.  I really doubt that there is a school today in the US that treats two students differently that are equal in all but skin color or \"racial category\" status  (if we ignore, for a moment, the matter of intentional promotion of certain minorities).",

Washington DC consistently ranks amongst the highest in terms of per capita student spending and amongst the lowest in terms of academic performance.\n\nIndeed, poverty isn't primarily responsible for the black/white achievement gap.\n\nhttps://www.jbhe.com/features/49_college_admissions-test.html\n\nThe reality is that even the poorest white students do better than the richest white students on things like the SATs and other, similar measures of academic quality.\n\nThe idea that rich black students are going to terrible schools is badly undermined by the fact that they don't, and indeed, go to better schools on average than those rural whites are attending, with better finances and more access to good teachers.\n\nAnd yet, they're still doing worse.\n\nAnd that's comparing the richest black kids to the poorest white ones. Compare the rich black kids to the rich white ones, it's a 100+ point gap - despite the fact that these kids are often attending the same schools, or schools of equivalent quality.\n\nMoreover, if you look at black students who go to schools with lots of black students, and black students who go to schools with lots of white students, if you control for socioeconomic status, you find that they do about the same - there is only a very small advantage going to the predominantly white school, and that is likely because they are benefitting from being around more functional peers rather than because the teachers are vastly better (indeed, \"student body quality\" has about as large an impact on test scores as teacher quality).\n\nThe reality is that the idea that it is all about school funding or school quality is a Big Lie.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that variation in school quality (including peer quality) probably only accounts for 5-20% of variation in test scores.\n\nA supermajority of variation (60%+) is caused by variation in individual student quality (i.e. demographic factors).",

I recently  (on occasion of the Atlanta suburb secession debate) looked into Georgia's school financing, and while it still nominally ties funding  to the county (or school district, for that matter), they shaped that in a form that ensures equal funding per student regardless of county all across Georgia.  I suspect similar reforms happened elsewhere, so that makes the US at least partially a place with fair school funding.",

But it stopped a generation afterwards, and has held relatively steady since then, at around 1-1.1 standard deviations.\n\nMoreover, if you look at, for instance, black students who go to majority white schools, the difference between their scores and the students who go to majority black schools, after controlling for demographic factors, is quite small.\n\nOn top of this, we see similarish gaps across the entire US. The argument that this must be caused by racism is incredibly dubious - the level of racism varies significantly across the US.\n\nMoreover, we see similar gaps in other countries, which don't have the same history as the US.\n\nThis renders belief in \"systemic racism\" obviously implausible as the primary explanation for the gap.\n\nOn top of that, there's the additional fact that Native Americans - who still suffer under a system of pseudo-segregation due to the Reservations - do *better* than black students. This despite the fact that Native Americans are slightly poorer than blacks are.\n\nAdditionally, Asian Americans actually OUTSCORE whites on standardized tests. If racism is so strong, why is it that Asians somehow are immune to it? We put Japanese Americans in concentration camps during World War II!\n\nThe reality is that the religious belief in systemic racism is not grounded in factual reality.\n\nWhatever factors cause these disparities must primarily originate elsewhere.",

Failure to control for confounding factors will always result in misleading data.\n\nWhy do you think that impoverished white kids in rural hickville do better on the SATs than rich black children?\n\nThe idea that poor kids in Appalachia are more privileged than the children of rich black professionals is obviously farcical.\n\nAnd yet white students with a familial income of less than $10k/year do better on the SATs on average than black students with a familial income north of $100k/year.\n\nYou're comparing people who are literally dirt poor to people whose families enjoy significant privilege. And yet, they're still doing a bit better.\n\nIt's obviously ridiculous to claim this is due to something other than demographic factors.\n\nThe reality is that demographics make a huge difference.\n\nIn fact, studies on student performance find that only 5-20% of variance in performance can be attributed to school quality.\n\nConversely, they consistently find a supermajority (north of 60%) of variance in performance can be attributed to \"student quality\" (demographic factors).\n\nA school that teaches only rich white and Asian students will get very high test scores - but such students will do well ANYWHERE.\n\nA school that teaches only poor black students and manages to increase their scores by 20 points relative to the poor black student average is doing better than a school that teaches only rich white and Asian students who do average for their demographic level. This despite the fact that the black students will massively, massively underperform.\n\nIf you want to isolate the factor of school quality, you need to compare like to like.\n\nThis is basic experimental controls.\n\nCompare black American students to Australian Aboriginal students. Both are very disadvantaged and are minorities with a long history of historical discrimination. Who does better? Black American students.\n\nSo Australia, objectively, does a worse job of educating its disadvantaged minority.\n\nBut Aboriginal Australians make up only 3% of the population there, compared to 12% in the US. So even though black Americans do better, they have a larger negative effect on the overall US average.\n\nBut it is obviously farcical to claim that the US is doing worse when its subgroups are all doing better.\n\nThis is basic science.

I can understand that they were rushing to get the vaccine approved and people being people and companies being companies with their tendency to cut corners and cover mistakes. I don't think it changes the outcomes substantially but it might be that the vaccine effectiveness is actually slightly less than originally thought. \nMy issue is that when Astra Zeneca found some irregularities with their studies due to very bizarre circumstances with product testing and they were completely open and forthcoming, they were completely vilified by the media and politicians. It doesn't provide any incentives for companies to be open at all. Pfizer's incident shows that it is better to deny or cover up everything and when they are finally exposed then say that it is not a big deal. ",

So that's in your favor.  \n\nI'm starting to wonder if J&J will be available as either primary or booster for very long (or if some employers will start saying it \"doesn't count\" for you being \"fully vaccinated\").  \n\nA study of VA hospital cases of 620,000 US veterans found that while effectiveness (at preventing infection - unfortunately they didn't study outcomes) for Moderna and Pfizer was still slightly above 50% at 6-months post vaccination, but for J&J was only 3%.

There is likely no coincidence that the majority of suspected vaccine induced cases are people who very recently received the shot. If say a patient had covid say 3 or 4 months prior and the vaccine only 2 weeks before the condition begins, which is more likely the cause?",

When the FDA issued their EUA, they confirmed very high efficacy in the order of 95% effectiveness in preventing severe illness and death.\n\nNobody ever predicted the level at which herd immunity would be achieved with these vaccines. I remember Fauci saying it would have to be at least 70% but we don't know.\n\nWe have not broadened the idea of what a vaccine is, unless you call the inclusion of vaccines made with mRNA technology \"broadening\". Vaccines for seasonal flu have always had much lower efficacy - like around 50%.\n\nIt is disappointing that the immunity from the vaccines wanes faster than hoped. It seems spacing out the initial doses from 8 to 12 weeks does help make them more effective. Childhood vaccines are routinely administered with a handful of doses administered at least 6 months apart. You need to check your expectations.\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/vaccines-need-not-completely-stop-covid-transmission-to-curb-the-pandemic1/\n\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/09/sterilizing-immunity-myth-covid-19-vaccines/620023/",

They were designed to lower symptoms. Basically it's a flu vaccine in drag. Whatever, it certainly doesn't justify mandates or passports on any grounds as it will not lead to herd. Have we ever really reached herd with influenza? We rely on natural immunity to get by. These are not diseases we can possibly control and 'defeat' with vaccines. I don't see how. ",

It rested on the assumption that the population of the UK would allow the government to do almost nothing while 210,000 - 315,000 people died over a short period. Whether or not it was a good plan is irrelevant. The assumption was obviously insane, and the plan was worthless. \n\nThe document setting out the plan is an interesting example of a well-written, coherent and convincing 70 page strategy document being worse than useless. It's not perfect, but you can tell that a lot of intelligent, knowledgeable people have put a lot of work into it, and you can see why the UK got such good marks for pandemic preparedness from international assessors. Ignore the \"Influenza Pandemic Strategy\" title, the plan specifically states that it can be applied to a SARS virus, and Covid falls within its assumptions as to possible transmissibility and case fatality rate.\n\nIt's worse than useless because it hides the reality of the situation it's planning for. The first sentences of the introduction should have been \"This plan is based on 200,000 to 300,000 people dying from the infection in a three month period. We aren't going to try to stop that happening.\" But over seventy pages, and no doubt hundreds of other documents stemming from those seventy pages, the ludicrous assumption at its heart is swathed in layer after layer of reassuring competence, and utter nonsense was transformed into a gold standard public policy strategy.\n\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/213717/dh_131040.pdf",

They have supported essentially every lockdown, even in Jan-March 2021, almost a year on from the start of the pandemic restrictions. Yes there's absolutely a vocal minority who don't support them, but the majority consistently did as we know from all polling data.\n\nThe first lockdown was almost inarguably a good idea, and that's the one we're referring to, as it allowed breathing space to create a massive expansion of govt and medical capacity, as well as the space to do large-scale trials that revealed dexamethasone by June 2020, which dramatically improved the survival chances going forward. There would have been a far higher death rate without this discovery.\n\nMuch of the media hostility revolved around the fact that the likely death rate for an un-checked pandemic at that time, without proper medical treatments, was going to be more than half a million people.\n\n\n\n\n",

Everybody thought that lockdowns worked and one politician even wrote a book ‚Äì how we won the covid. But then winter came and lockdowns completely failed. Some say that it is because they were started too late. Maybe, but then the delay was only because they were so devastating that no one wanted to do them again. \nOn the other hand Sweden managed with restrictions that were very close to lockdowns but not yet. They initially had more cases but at the end they managed to become an average country in this regard.\nI think that lockdowns are very crude measure. With our knowledge we should have chosen more targeted and decentralized approach. Countries didn't do that because they wanted zero covid which requires centralized control. \n\nRemember when CDC botched testing and did not allow hospitals to do their own tests? It wasn't a mistake. They wanted to have a complete control in the misguided belief that they will be able to control and eliminate all cases.\nI believe that if we had allowed more home testing, eliminated superspreader events, done more about local prevention, ventilation etc., the results would have been comparable to any lockdown. In Spring 2020 it was understandable that we didn't know what to do because aerosol spread was only a theory. But all subsequent lockdowns (even current reintroduction of lockdowns in the EU, even in countries with high vaccination uptake) is where experts failed even by their own standards.",

No one seems to care about that one though. Odd!\n\n\"Disparaging New Zealand does not further your argument .\"\n\nIt does, in fact, because a lot of the \"Why didn't you do what New Zealand did!\" ignores the fact that the scale and situation of the two countries is not remotely comparable. Physically NZ is about as big as Oregon and population-wise it's about as big as Minnesota. And, of course, it's surrounded by thousands of miles of ocean as opposed to thousands of miles of, at best, inconsistently guarded land borders. Tactics you can do in one will not work in the other.\n\nAlso, disparaging New Zealand is always a good idea on general principles.\n\n\"Under your constitution, there are exceptions for matters of public health.\"\n\nI don't recall the bit in the freedom of assembly clause about \"of course all this is void if a couple people catch the sniffles,\" and the bit in freedom of expression about \"of course all this is void if some cranks start advocating eating horse paste,\" but perhaps you can point me to them.\n\n\"The idea that the lockdowns was to slow the spread so that hospitals would not be over-run.

Anyone not listening to Trump would tell you that a wall wouldn't work and is a really bad idea for a host of reasons.   Border security can be stepped up without a wall,  and locking down international borders at the pandemic outset was more about stopping travel from Europe and Asia.\nSuggesting that the pandemic was caused by \"gain of function research\" is a sideshow run by Rand Paul.  There is no evidence that happened.   But even if it did,   and whether or not the development or the release of the virus was intentional,   My point still stands that the US did not have monitoring in place to catch a new outbreak at the earliest opportunity thanks to the wisdom of 45.\nNew Zealand had a lower all cause mortality rate during the pandemic than their historic average.  Why would you want to disparage that record?\nHow many deaths in the US?  760,000 officially?   More than a million if you look at the all excess mortality figures,   but hey! you got the supreme court packed with the judges endorsed by the federalist society!",

So should you.\n\nRegarding you dragging Trump into this: If someone sets your house on fire, and the firefighters were bad at their job and failed to put out the fire before it burned the house down, that doesn't mean we shrug and smile and shake hands with the arsonist and move on. Go ahead and fire the firefighters, but the arsonist is far, far worse and it's most important to bring the arsonist to justice.\n\nRegarding New Zealand, New Zealand sucks. It's full of smug, sneering, superior virtue signalers who think that because they live on a tiny island that can just hide from problems they're qualified to lecture the rest of the planet on what to do. If it sank into the sea tomorrow I wouldn't shed a single tear.

Don't worry, I won't make that mistake again.\n\n\"Just how much of a difference bussing some migrants around made to the pandemic?\"\n\n...what the fuck? That makes it _okay_? When at the same time we're diverting airplanes because a two year old wouldn't keep his mask on?\n\nLook, if your argument is that there's no point in zero tolerance enforcement given that the disease has been endemic for over a year and we just need to relax, then, hey, I agree! But we can't continue to operate under a situation of anarcho-tyranny where we crack down on unmasked toddlers with all the power of the state while at the same time waving Covid-positive illegal immigrants over the border and handing them bus tickets. People notice this, you know. This policy execution is literally insane and if you don't realize that you're going to continue to fail to understand how we got where we are.\n\nAnyway, I'm out -- feel free to continue complaining about Donald Trump to the void if you want.",

The aliens say this is idiotic, vaccines originally come from cowpox, even the word ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù comes from Latin vaccus meaning ‚Äúcow‚Äù, are you saying you want cow medicine instead of actual brain implants which alien Science has proven will work? They make lots of cartoons displaying humans who want vaccines as having cow heads, or rolling around in cow poop. Meanwhile, the first few dozen studies show vaccines work great. Many top human leaders, including war heroes from the struggle against the aliens, get vaccines and are seen going out in public, looking healthy and happy.\"",

You can't as easily do RCTs once a drug is being used widely, because you get selection bias issues for who is willing to participate.\n\n3. You can allow widespread access + randomization fairly easily, if it's planned for. And in a medical system less messed up than the US, it's straightforward to do this, which is exactly how the UK's RECOVERY trial was set up in April 2020.\n\nAnd no, this wouldn't have ruled out trying lockdowns, especially because 1) we had incredibly clear evidence of effectiveness, and 2) it's not a medical intervention, so the way RCTs are done is very different.\n \nAnd honestly, we probably would have gotten masks used more quickly in the US if we had done trials immeidately, compared what actually happened - which was listening to the surgeon general and CDC which delayed until the evidence was incontrovertible anyways - and for some insane reason, still won't require HEPA filters, etc. (Compare this to the Japanese government experts, who got both of these right on day 1 based on actually looking at the initial outbreaks.)",

You claim to be helped by statistical analysis yet don't seem to know the difference between data and anecdata!\n\nI said that supply responding to demand *generally* happens, not that it is perfect.

We can build replica factories that produce chips of the latest size. The problem is, you can't actually just add on more stuff to an existing fab, which are often already running 24/7 - you have to build another entire factory, which is expensive and time consuming, on the order of a few years.\n\nSecondly, it's not a terribly unique situation. A 24/5 factory can move to 24/7, but a 24/7 factory can't run to 24/8. If you run past 24/7, you have to build another factory in many cases to ramp up further.",

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd want to be a patient in 1749.\n\nObviously physicians make decisions without high quality evidence all the time! We don‚Äôt have an RCT to answer every single question (nor would that be a good use of time or resources!). But ‚Äúgetting along ok‚Äù is in the eye of the beholder. I don‚Äôt think thousands of people dying everyday was ‚Äúgetting along ok‚Äù, and I don‚Äôt think you do either.\n\nI get the reasoning behind the thought that if a drug is largely known to be safe and there‚Äôs some not so great evidence that it works we may as well try it. The problem is, practically, it makes practicing medicine even more difficult than it already is, with very little benefit. Most things with sort of ok evidence don‚Äôt work, yet you spend a ton of time talking about these things with patients and their families, when, during a crisis you‚Äôre already stretched quite thin. During the early days I was asked to prescribe HCQ (and did for a few patients-I regret that), vitamin C, convalescent plasma, the regeneon monoclonal antibody in patients where it had been shown to have no benefit. Each time I tried to patiently and compassionately explain why I didn‚Äôt think those things made sense and in some cases couldn‚Äôt be sure they wouldn‚Äôt be harmful. So multiply a service of 20 patients x 40% who trusted news sources on the internet and TV more than their own physician x an average conversation of 20 minutes (sometimes much longer) and you‚Äôre spending hours a day having these conversations. In the meantime, a lot of unscrupulous people have made a lot of money and given people a false sense of security by feeding them false information about ivermectin.\n\nAnd then, to come back to my original point‚Äîif you‚Äôre an individual doctor just prescribing a medicine it‚Äôs very very hard to tell if it works or not. A doctor who says ‚Äúwe‚Äôll I gave this medicine 10 times and it worked every time‚Äù and sees that as strong evidence without skepticism either has an alternate agenda or has a really poor grasp of science. \n\nI wish so badly that ivermectin worked in a way that was meaningful! It would safe so much death and miserly. But no one has demonstrated that it does.",

Because then even when you do get good RCT results, you end up having to wait for further approvals before that can be applied in the field, and in the interim more lives are lost.

We started prescribing dexamethasone a few days after the top line result of RECOVERY came out‚Äîno FDA approval necessary as it was already an approved drug. If a high quality ivermectin study came out, docs would start giving it to patients-we wouldn‚Äôt need anything from the FDA! This isn‚Äôt a question of gatekeeping, it‚Äôs a question of how you know what helps or not. There is an enormously long list of potential therapies, in particular in critical care, that very smart people had very good reason to believe would work, and unfortunately almost all of them were useless, or even harmful, when studied rigorously. So to go back to my original point-if you just give something and ‚Äúsee if it works‚Äù you have a problem because it‚Äôs just about impossible to do that. \n\nWe would have been MUCH better off if there was an RCT in the first months of the pandemic of ivermectin‚Äîmaybe it would have even shown benefit (though to me it seems unlikely)! Instead we will likely never know, and have wasted a bunch of time and energy.\n\nYou seem like a cool person and I hope even if I haven‚Äôt convinced you of anything that you‚Äôve found me respectful and informative.

If you're withholding a drug that might work, that opens the door to stories about the authorities suppressing a miracle cure. If you're including the drug in the experimental drug cocktail, then you just need to find a find a way to convey \"experimental drug cocktail\". Here are some things that might help, studies are underway to figure out which of them really help, we can at least be pretty sure that they don't do much harm.

Of course, clinical trials are broken, as is the US healthcare system, so this probably isn't happening in the US, at least this decade.\n\nBut for \"navigating the information environment,\" there's a huge difference between telling people we have unclear preliminary indications and recommending or prescribing medicines. (But again, US healthcare is broken, the FDA is broken, etc. as Scott has discussed in the past, so this gets screwed up.) And as I said below, telling people \"this probably works\" has some massive downsides in practice, as we see from the fact that there are still people taking HCQ instead of getting vaccinated.",

We don't generally test most drugs for drug combinations unless we expect them to be used in conjunction with each other. Many drugs are not safe to take with other drugs, but we don't know that because we don't typically mix them.\n\nSecondly, combined drugs don't necessarily have linear effects with each other; sometimes they will counteract each other, sometimes they will multiply each others' effects. So you can't even be sure that the drugs will work at all.\n\nThirdly, taking more drugs greatly increases the probability of organ failure (mostly kidney and liver failure).\n\nFourth, almost all of these drugs are ineffective, meaning you are wasting vast amounts of resources when there are better things to do.\n\nFifth, most of these drugs are only produced in limited quantities and cannot be rapidly scaled up. So you will create shortages for things that they are actually important for.\n\nSixth, almost all drugs have side effects. The more drugs are taking, the more likely you are to experience side effects, and this actually is even worse with mixing drugs.\n\nSeventh, most of the population is completely incapable of making educated decisions about their health like this, because they can't do the proper risk/benefit analysis.",

I've been trying to listen to the Covid Clinical Update on TWIV as often as possible, for example--that's available to anyone but it's mostly a top tier ID doctor who's been treating covid patients for the last 18 months talking about what treatments seem to work, how they're used, what the promising stuff coming down the pike is, what the research looks like, etc.  \n\nAnd that leaves the possibility that people are going to misunderstand it, or misinterpret it, or whatever.  The only way to prevent that is to keep anyone but certified experts from being allowed to see any of that information, which fails the \"let the medical student debunk the fraudulent study\" test, as well as the \"let the Turkish sociologist make much better recommendations than the national health authorities\" test.

But if there were no concerted effort to shut down discussion of that drug, further results would have shown 1) side effects or other issues, 2) lack of efficacy, or 3) hey this thing really works!  Option 1 gets communicated to patients by their doctor, and the doctor steers patients away, especially if 2 is proven or seems likely.  Option 2 the doctors simply stop offering it as an option.  Option 3 sounds like a best case scenario, not an apocalyptic harm.  \n\nIf it really works, then I think people should be able to go ahead and skip the vaccine or whatever else you're worried about.  If it doesn't work, but conversations are allowed to happen about it like normal, then the incentive to take it instead of the vaccine goes away.  ",

My belief is that from the scientific evidence, since the vaccines don't stop spread, even if 100% of the world population by some scant luck had taken the vaccine, it can still spread and mutate and would eventually develop into a more infectious strain such as how we have Delta today.\n\nVaccines that don't prevent vaccines, i.e. leaky vaccines are that by their inherent nature, not able to completely eliminate a virus. Eventually, since the virus still exists in a COVID-19 vaccinated environment, it would have mutated and spread into a more infectious strain.\n\nThe only difference is today we blame the unvaccinated as speeding up that spread and responsible for the Delta variant.",

COVID-19 has an R0 of something like 8-12, so even a vaccine that cuts infection by 6x will only reduce it to 1.2-2, which is still not low enough.\n\nThe reality is that you have to have full measures going on - masks, vaccines, no indoor dining, social distancing, no in-person school, work from home where possible, etc.",

A few comments:\n* First I don't think that it is correct that they used non-contemporaneous controls for the ivermectin TOGETHER study. This is a well-known problem in adaptive trials where new arms can enter and leave the platform. The controls that they will have used are only those who could have been randomised to ivermectin. See for example their write up of fluvoxamine (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(21)00448-4/fulltext)\n*  Regarding fluvoxamine: interesting that your assessment is that it \"works\". From a Bayesian perspective, a priori it's highly unlikely to do anything (some random doc decided to test because why not; no known mechanism of action); and there is a real problem of post-randomisation bias.

A-priori it seems unlikely that we got really good at saving people at the point of practically choking on their own fluids with existing meds (steroids, etc), but apparently there was nothing whatsoever that could be done preventitively to help. Not only that, but we were absolutely certain of this beyond any shadow of any conceivable doubt. We were certain that the physiological profile of covid-19 was PERFECTLY disjoint from the sum total of existing medical practice.\n\nIt's simply unforgivable that our elites ignored the attack on therapeutics.\n\nThe thrust of your claim that \"this is one of the most carefully-pored-over scientific issues of our time\" just doesn't hold water. It's been two years and you're still not sure if it might be moderately helpful (nvm Vit D. and all the others). In no universe can we call this a functioning medical science establishment. \n\nThe fact of the matter is a bunch of elites decided that their reputation was far more important to them than the off chance of saving many lives.

If someone starts out by asking [is X true], they‚Äôre jumping to a 100-bit proposition, without a corresponding 98 bits of evidence to locate it in the answer space as a possibility worthy of explicit consideration.

And on that level, given the \"worm impact,\" it appears even to have been right for those cases!\n\nOf course, in the latter case, you need to ask why this medicine and not others. But I think the response is something like, \"docters all over the world have been trying everything they can think of, and this one stuck.\" Also it wasn't the only one, there are others that have some (maybe low) evidence that are now being followed up.\n\nThe problem for me, isn't that, it is going from low confidence priors, to high confidence. I don't understand that, even in the faces of Scott's Australia conquering aliens. Wouldn't you just distrust everything? Why does low-confidence evidence from alternatives sources get trusted?",

Theory states it enables zinc to enter the cell and stop replication of viruses and it prevents inflamation. So a doctor tried it and had good results. Soon other doctors were using it and found it to be effective keeping people out of the hospital. Good RTCs are very expensive and there is zero profit in doing one for a generic drug, but a very big incentive to do a fake study to prove the generic doesn't work, If the author didn't point this out in his evaluation, it undermines his credability to the point his opinion is useless. We don't need more blind people to follow.  ",

How much is Putin paying you?  There is no evidence for these bizarre and ever expanding \"the Russians did it!\" conspiracy theories, and if you actually talk to people outside of your bubble you'll find that they are just normal people making rational decisions, not Russian bots.  They simply have access to different information than you, or have different priorities than you.  In reality, some \"conspiracy theorists\" exhibit less cognitive bias, not more.  This is because many \"conspiracy theories\" are simply plausible scenarios that lack definitive evidence but the media has declared forbidden.  Such as SARS-COV-2 being created in a lab.  That was a \"far right conspiracy theory\" that was auto-banned from all social media in April.  Then it was a plausible mainstream hypothesis in May, simply because of the unlikely happenstance that two journalists with integrity existed.",

There is some evidence in favor of Ivermectin, but it is too weak to overcome the priors.\" I guess she passed this rationality test with flying colors.\n\nBut the quality of one's priors depends on their knowledge. As an extreme example, if you have no idea what \"ivermectin\" or \"covid\" mean, you could go with: \"well, you asked me a yes/no question, so the prior probability of yes is 50%\".\n\nA better model would be that ivermectin is a \"cure\" and covid is a \"virus\", and it is generally known that you can use a \"cure\" against a \"virus\", although not every \"cure\" against every \"virus\", but still the chances of ivermectin are way better than... the chances of a random object you would pick up in a shop...\n\nA yet better model is that killing a virus is not the hard part (an atomic bomb surely destroys covid, too), the problem is to find a cure that succeeds to kill the virus without hurting the human too much, which is quite difficult.\n\nAnd then, people like my wife can have even better model of how ivermectin works, how covid works, so their priors can be even more precise.\n\nProblem is, better priors are often built from more background knowledge, which makes them more difficult to communicate to other people. For that reason, I did not try to argue with my wife, I just asked how certain she feels about what she said, and I trusted her judgment.\n\nThis again required me to have priors about the quality of her judgment, which are quite high. And that again is because I have a lot of data about her. So I wouldn't expect her reasoning to be equally convincing to other people. Therefore, I didn't try to convince other people by saying \"because my wife said so, and I trust her\"; that obviously wouldn't work.",

As best I can tell, current estimates on effectiveness against transmission range from a low of 20% (five or six months after vaccination) to about 60%.  Effectiveness against death is 90-95%.\n\nThe pattern of infection over time doesn't seem to have changed very much even in countries with high vaccination rates, which suggests that changes in behavior are enough to roughly balance protection against infection. What has been sharply reduced is mortality from Covid.\n\nFor a picture of infection rates over time, see:\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases",

This is not widely broadcast by the media, but your overly optimistic view of the efficacy is clearly shown to be mistaken just by looking at vaccination rate vs case rate data.  Why does Gibraltar still have so many cases when 100% of the adult population is vaccinated?  If the vaccine were highly effective at preventing transmission, we should see a substantial difference in case rates in highly vaccinated countries vs low vaccination countries, but we do not.  We only see a difference in death rates.  Also, reducing the risk of serious illness is not relevant here.  If people want to risk their own lives, that is their decision.  The only moral argument is the risk they pose to others.",

No, there is absolutely no measured difference in infection rates in highly vaccinated areas vs low vaccination areas.  The infection rate of vaccinated vs unvaccinated individuals is not the question, as that does not support your insistence on trying to force the vaccines on others.  You might also consider reading the bullshit you regurgitate sometime.  Despite the dishonest labelling the CDC uses, they do of course admit in the fine print that \"unvaccinated\" does not mean unvaccinated, it means \"have not had 2 (soon to be 3) doses of the vaccines we choose to count for an arbitrary length of time\".  Many of the \"unvaccinated\" in that graph are vaccinated, just not with two shots, or not with the \"right\" vaccine, or it hasn't been two weeks since their second shot yet.  And since your odds of getting covid are dramatically INCREASED in the week following vaccination, that's clearly chosen precisely to mislead the public.",

Trust but verify is the rule one must follow to avoid falling victim to quacks. Lies by the establishment on a wide range of issues has caused skepticism by a growing number of people. Many brilliant scientists, doctors, and lawyers, such as Dr. Fleming, Dr. Peter McCullough, Dr. Breggin, Vladimir Zelenko MD,  and Paul Alexander PhD became concerned enough to look into all aspects of the pandemic in depth, and are very frightened by what they found. When hightly trained leaders in the field of medicine sound alarm, a wise person would listen to what they have to say, not plug their ears, close their eyes and dismiss their argument without taking the time to listen to them. The fact Big Pharma refused to respond to their concerns, and Big Tech silenced them, re-enforces my belief, something horrible has gone wrong. ",

They understand vaccine science and learned from experience that many things can go wrong, go wrong, go wrong... That's why it takes years to develop safe vaccines. The new technology these vaccines are based on, has the potential to be a miracle cure for a wide range of aliments. Evidence of problems that weren't addressed is growing and if they turn out to be true, it will set the technology back decades.

Your argument is that \"many things can go wrong\", so that is an admission that things have not yet gone wrong.   It is the tactic of the anti-vax cult to sow fear around uncertainty and you are a victim of that.

The thing to fear is still the virus.",

And second of all, that applies even *more* to ivermectin, since it's less likely to benefit you than the vaccine.\n\nVaccine-only makes sense, ivermectin and vaccine is probably pointless but probably no worse, but ivermectin and no vaccine is deliberately ignoring the most effective tool in the toolbox.",

What absolute risk reduction needs to occur for you to deem some behaviour morally required?  There are lots of things we could demand people do that would slightly lower transmission.  We do not demand people do them, why is the vaccine so special?\n\nYour analysis of ivermectin vs vaccine is only looking at the positives, and ignoring the negatives.  Ivermectin has a long history of safety.  The known risk of harm is incredibly low, and the odds of an unknown risk are also incredibly low.  MRNA vaccines have a long history of being unsafe, and of scientists declaring that they will never be able to be approved because of inherent safety problems.  The known risk of harm from the vaccines is much higher than ivermectin, and the potential for unknown harm is even higher still.  When you consider both the benefits and the harms, it becomes much more understandable that someone would choose not to be vaccinated, and then choose to take ivermectin if they get COVID (and know they got it).",

Covid vaccines carry little known risk. But the perils of Covid-19 have been well documented. About 20 percent of people who come down with Covid-19 symptoms develop serious, potentially life-threatening illness. Although people who are older, obese or have other health problems are at highest risk for complications from Covid-19, younger people can become severely ill, too. In a study of more than 3,000 people ages 18 to 34 who were hospitalized for Covid, 20 percent required intensive care and 3 percent died. The long-term health complications associated with Covid-19 are a serious concern. As many as one in three people who recover from Covid have chronic complaints for months afterward, including exhaustion, a racing heart, blood clots and loss of sense of smell or taste.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus?name=styln-coronavirus&region=TOP_BANNER&block=storyline_menu_recirc&action=click&pgtype=Interactive&variant=1_Show\n",

The risk posed by covid in a young, healthy individual is ZERO.  Not small.  ZERO.  There is not a single case of a young healthy person dying from covid.  And you know this is true, because now that you tried to find an example for the first time ever, you realized there are none.  So you laughably resorted to using an unhealthy 48 year old dying of unknown causes because it is the closest thing you could come up with.  No, trying to outsource your example finding to reddit is not productive.  Multiple unhealthy people dying from covid do not ever add up to one healthy person dying from covid.",

It is not reasonable to expect me to spend hours digging into every case you spent 30 seconds googling.  I did not assume they all died from vaccine induced myocarditis, only the one case that anyone could possibly construe as being a young healthy person.  The one who your article clearly but falsely says did not die of covid, but rather from myocarditis.\n\nAdeline Fagan: asthma and some unspecified cardiovascular problem, which is what actually killed her due to a brain bleed, AFTER SHE HAD BEEN CLEARED OF COVID.\n\nYasmin Pena: HAD FUCKING LUPUS!  Are you kidding me?  Come on.\n\nI was giving you the benefit of the doubt that you were only suggesting Michael Lang was an example.  The fact that you were so lazy that you would pretend all 3 of them are is sad.  That you would then try to play this redditard \"oh if you point out how lazy and dishonest I am that means I win!1111\" game makes it impossible to believe you care AT ALL about the truth.\n\nVarious \"news\" articles say Lang died from covid, with covid, \"apparently due to complications from covid\", from a heart attack, from myocarditis, and several vague \"after having isolated for covid\" type statements.  It seems more likely that he died from a heart attack unrelated to covid, and may very well have not even had covid, since he had nothing but normal mild cold/flu symptoms, and tested negative.  He only got a single positive PCR test after repeated testing, and that was after he no longer had symptoms.  Then he had a heart attack and died.  No, I would not consider that as evidence that young healthy people can die from covid without some evidence that he did in fact die from covid.  But if you were making the decision to get vaccinated based on that case, I wouldn't think you were crazy.  Just bad at math.",

Apologize for asserting that the myocarditis was caused by a vaccine that couldn't have been a factor?   \nYou also asserted that these three people did not die.  Which was clearly incorrect.\nYou are arguing in bad faith.\nCovid causes Myocarditis.  And yes, it is possible that Lang had a previously undiagnosed case.  but that is not what is doctors thought.  Equally though, You may have an undiagnosed case as well.   Prior to this event everyone thought he was healthy.\nIn any case,  You really cannot say that these people did not die as a result of covid. You did not examine them yourself, and I am pretty sure you are not qualified.   Rather, you are prone  to believe anything that supports your beliefs.  \nYazman was diagnosed with lupus, but the article doesn't say if that may have been a misdiagnosis, or something that may have been triggered by the Covid infection. or as you suggest a pre-existing condition that had gone unnoticed until she picked up Covid.   Again,  you might unknowingly have lupus like she did (or didn't if it was a misdiagnosis).\n\n\nFalse negatives, however, are more common. According to PHAC, approximately 98 per cent of patients tested within two days of their exposure will still get a negative result from PCR tests. That number drops to 50 per cent over the first five days post-exposure, and 10 per cent after that until symptoms disappear.\nhttps://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/fact-check-how-accurate-are-pcr-tests-for-the-novel-coronavirus-1.5257357\n\nAdeline Fagan: did have some health issues from earlier in life it seems.  It is pretty clear that she would still be alive if it were not for her catching covid though.  But you did ask for healthy people., so here are some more anecdotes:  This time from even earlier - April 2020- Pre Delta and Vaccines. Unfortunately the details given are slim, but the article is published by a hospital.\n\nhttp://protomag.com/articles/why-do-young-healthy-people-die-covid-19",

Other people mentioned the case, you can gather more information from more sources rather than rely on a couple paragraphs written by a moron intending to manipulate people's emotions rather than inform them.\n\n>Again, you might unknowingly have lupus like she did\n\nHow do you maintain your self perception as being objective and rational?

But my initial impression came back when writing my most recent response.   \n\nYou still have not acknowledged  that you made a false assumption when you asserted that they died due to a vaccination\"\n\nYou have set a very low bar in challenging me:  \"There is not a single case of a young healthy person dying from covid\", but then you moved the goalposts.     When presented with a small sample of some anecdotes you made your own assumptions about pre-existing conditions  \nMichael Lang is the strongest case of the three, and he only fails your test if you assume that he had a previously undiagnosed case of myocarditis.    You attempted to argue that he did not have covid based on 2 or 3 PCR tests coming back negative.   Did you not know that PCR tests have a high false negative rate and a very low false positive rate?   This is how Delta arrived in NZ and Aus - Two Negative PCR tests during a strict 2 week quarantine gave the all clear on travelers that turned out to be positive.   These cases have been extensively analysed. \n\nLooking at some of your other posts, you are against \"social distancing\", and vaccinating groups that are at lower risk of death due to covid.   \nYou seem to think that the mRNA vaccines are more dangerous and less effective than the worldwide scientific consensus.  At the same time you have understated the risks involved with covid: \" a cold with virtually no risk,\"  when it appears that original Covid was ~ 10 x more transmissalbe AND had 10 X the mortality rate than common influenza strains that are already of serious  concern to public heath authorities every year.\nYou also seemingly fail to understand that implementing imperfect measures to stem the transmission of the virus can on aggregate can have a large impact on how the pandemic progresses.  Having an R0  value lowered from 1.1 down to 0.9 has huge implications.\nLast year there was clear data comparing similar towns where the difference was a college that re-opened.   There was a clear increase in covid cases and deaths in nursing homes in communities where there were colleges because the young healthy students picked up cases and spread them around the community.    \n\nI suggest you read the article in the Atlantic regarding Alex Berenson being \" pandemics wrongest man. \"  I agree with the points made and you are free to refute any assertations made. \n https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/pandemics-wrongest-man/618475/\n\nThe Atlantic also did a piece on the misinformation spread by Robert Malone. \nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/08/robert-malone-vaccine-inventor-vaccine-skeptic/619734/\n\nYou may dismiss the Atlantic as a \"tabloid\",  however, it is considered unbiased and highly reliable, as is their \"covid Tracking Project\"\n\nThe bottom line is that while your risk as individual may be low,  the pandemic itself has been and continues to be very disruptive around the world.   It is not helpful for you to oppose the public health measures in place to manage it.   I have a great deal of sympathy for those whos lively hoods were disrupted by the lockdown measures taken.   I have little to no sympathy for those that feel that puttying on a mask or getting a vaccine is somehow a violation of their human rights.\n",

Nothing has moved.  You presented unhealthy people, because you did not take any time to actually look into the cases before throwing them at me.  You did this out of either laziness, or ideological blindness, assuming that because the media repeats the lie that covid is dangerous to healthy young people, that it must be true.\n\n>You still have not acknowledged that you made a false assumption when you asserted that they died due to a vaccination\"\n\nThis is me pressing the \"acknowledged\" button.  Yes, I initially spent as little time as you did.  I also explained why.\n\n>I suggest you read the article in the Atlantic regarding Alex Berenson being \" pandemics wrongest man. \"\n\nI did.  It is entirely bullshit.  There isn't a single, objective claim presented by Berenson that was actually wrong.  Being called \"the wrongest\" does not make him wrong.\n\n>You may dismiss the Atlantic as a \"tabloid\", however, it is considered unbiased and highly reliable\n\nBy people who share their bias.\n\n>It is not helpful for you to oppose the public health measures in place to manage it.\n\nYes it is.  The public health measures have, and continue to cause more deaths, not prevent them.\n\n> I have little to no sympathy for those that feel that puttying on a mask or getting a vaccine is somehow a violation of their human rights.\n\nDemanding that I risk death because it makes you feel better emotionally is both irrational, and immoral.  The vaccinated have much higher all cause mortality rate than the unvaccinated.  Ignoring the risks and pretending it is purely a question of the benefits is not compelling.",

Influenza related deaths are often poorly documented, hence the CDC provides an estimate of flu deaths.\n\nIf you look at the last couple pre-Covid flu seasons, you have 251, 526 and 372 paediatric deaths. Which is quite a bit higher than the rate of paediatric Covid deaths. (Also, completely unsurprisingly because it is so rare, the official counts overstate paediatric Covid deaths. A range of sources - CDC, UK data - suggest about half the paediatric deaths are deaths with, not from Covid).\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018.htm\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2016-2017.html\n\nExactly where the crossover point is, idk, but likely decently north of 18. \n\nAlso, previous numbers are based off Covid deaths (without a vaccine available) to flu deaths (with a vaccine available). If you want to compare the latent danger of the two, you should hold vaccination status constant. \n\nGoing back a bit:\n\"1) SARS-CoV-2 is roughly 30x more fatal than influenza.\n\n2) COVID-19 has a roughly 5-10% rate of long-term side effects; many people are suffering from lasting disability from the disease.\"\n\nOn 1, from those same links, we have about 40k deaths per year from the flu over the 3 years pre-Covid. Idk how many Covid deaths you think we're going to have on a continuing basis, but if you really think it's going to be 1.2 million per year (to match 30x deadlier), I would be very happy to take a bet against this. It wasn't even close to 30x as high as the usual rate of flu deaths over the first year of the pandemic, when we had ~0 natural immunity to begin with and no vaccines!\n\nOn 2, those numbers are obviously wrong, lol. If you set aside all the self-selecting convenience samples and do things remotely properly, you get tiny rates, headline estimate here is 1.6% and obviously these are liable to be biased upwards: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/technicalarticleupdatedestimatesoftheprevalenceofpostacutesymptomsamongpeoplewithcoronaviruscovid19intheuk/26april2020to1august2021",

If you could read the sources I linked in my original reply to you, you would see the CDC estimates ~30m, ~40m and ~30m symptomatic flu cases in the 3 pre-pandemic flu seasons. And they estimate 124m symptomatic Covid cases in the first year and a half of the pandemic. This isn't even close, and you aren't even trying.\n\nI have no idea what point you think you're making about 2020-21 flu, but it should suffice to say it also disappeared at the same time in Sweden, without lockdowns or masking. QED. \n\n\"Except that also applies to COVID. We know that COVID deaths are an undercount, too.\"\n\nNo, we do not in fact know that Covid deaths are an undercount for kids. The reverse is true. (Yes, for adults Covid deaths are probably slightly undercounted. But a much smaller deal proportionally than the flu, because covid testing is common, and flu testing is rare. I don't think I've ever had a flu test in my life!)\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01578-1/tables/1",

(Honestly, I can't tell).\n\n\"The benefit of being vaccinated is that you would be less likely to get infected.\"\n\nTrue, alas just not anywhere near as much as we might have hoped initially (after a few months). And because natural immunity provides more effective protection against reinfection than the vaccines do, the relative odds of p(currently infected|vaccinated)/p(currently infected|unvaccinated) will very likely continue to rise over time and may even go above 1. (A while ago in the official British data they were indeed over 1, but testing rates may differ etc).\n\nThe point (that I take Mannan Javid to be making) is that a recent negative test is far more statistically informative than being vaccinated (in terms of the chance of being infected, and thus infecting others). Which undermines the claim that \"only by vaccinating are you not being a selfish jerk who is a threat to public health\". The people who argue this never seem to think that they are being equally selfish jerks by not getting tested regularly, something that is not that hard to do.",

Where is the (aside from perhaps people getting dozens of doses of vaccines) when you mention vaccines?  People do not think ivermectin is the reason they don't need to get vaccinated, they think the incredibly low risk posed by COVID is the reason they don't need to get vaccinated.  A healthy 25 year old has absolutely no reason to get vaccinated other than \"the TV told me to\".",

I'd like to see Scott's take.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/alexandrosM/status/1432247947601661952\n\nI will grant that these sorts of arguments are often used badly, such as \"IF IT SAVES ONE CHILD'S LIFE ITS WORTH IT\" etc. The appropriate way to respond to these sorts of bad faith applications of the argument are to dig out the trolley problem math. But in the case of IVM, it's so incredibly cheap and there's basically nobody dead on the other side of the trolley tracks no matter what, I can't see how the anti-IVM crowd can fully form the argument, other than crafting a \"false hope\" narrative. And I hate those because they must start with the presumption that humans are stupid cattle and their behavior must be manipulated for their own good. Banning IVM as behavioral manipulation will backfire, arguably already has backfired, due to Streisand Effect.",

I think you touched on that in earlier writings. I've been popping Zinc and D since the early HCQ days, writing most of the HCQ effect off to simply having better vitamins. I haven't bothered with IVM but whenever I do finally catch Covid (I think everyone is going to catch it sooner or later given the reinfection happening among the vaxxed) I plan on taking IVM unless there's better stuff out there by that point.\n\n$700 a pop \"Pfivermectin\" might work. I'm on record saying I think the thing that got Joe Rogan through, outside of his probably very robust immune system in general, was probably monoclonal antibodies. If anything is a true scandal, it should be the general suppression of monoclonal antibodies as a treatment. \n\nOne thing you'll notice in the responses to my post (scan up) is a lot of folks saying the bad thing about IVM is that it disincentivizes vaccination.  That's a super common theme among the IVM Culture War. The problem is that such a position should also suppress the distribution of other treatments that do work better than IVM. The pro vax crowd is so hung up on vaxxes that they'd suppress a perfectly safe and perfect Covid-19 treatment because it would suppress vax rates. This is more of a culture war issue than a medical issue, tied up with your \"I can tolerate anyone except the outgroup,\" and similar writings on my wall. ",

People have studied ivermectin in the context of curing river blindness, a very nasty disease, so below a certain level they're not even looking for side effects.  It's like (at a much lower level) if you've got a drug that can postpone death from Stage IV lung cancer by 6 months, you're not even going to bother asking whether people throw up more or less on it, or it gives them heart murmurs, or even causes leukemia 20 years later.\n\nDoes it happen that this ignorance is tragic?  Maybe.  Sometimes. In the 19th century, I believe physicians recommended smoking tobacco for various mild maladies on similar grounds: might help, couldn't hurt, seems totally safe, because nobody had died suddenly and abruptly from smoking.  Now, it turns out smoking gives you lung cancer after a few decades, which is pretty horrible, and totally not worth whatever benefit it might have  to losing weight or reducing anxiety -- but nobody knew about that, because nobody looked for it.\n\nThat's the problem.  When you interfere randomly in your biochemical machinery, it's always the unknown unknowns that will nail you.  So that's the important and unfortunately essentially impossible to quantify risk you need to weigh against the odds of a benefit.  Doesn't mean you don't decide to go for it, but it does mean it's not the case that there is ever zero drawback.",

Tobacco (nicotine specifically) is one of the only confirmed drugs that ameliorates Parkinson's Disease, but the researchers who have identified this (the evidence is solid) aren't even allowed to give presentations on their findings at conferences because of the stigma against smoking. \n\nAnd I think the \"yes but unknown long term effects\" thing is also pretty prominent among the IVM crowd who wants to avoid vaccination. One of the most important reasons to keep Covid vaccination from being mandatory is so there's a control group to compare long term outcomes against. It seems likely to me based on my reading that Covid-19 results in long term damage to the body because of these spike proteins. I'm not convinced that a smaller version (yet in some cases significant) of that damage is invoked by vaccination. I still got vaxxed, but I'm very uneasy about having a six month spike protein booster for this reason.\n\nI find stuff like this to be alarming:\n\nhttps://stephenc.substack.com/p/5-fold-increase-in-sudden-cardiac\n\nThat seems obviously related to either Covid-19 or the Covid-19 vaccinations.  Or both. I don't think an analysis like they did could differentiate between the two without a lot more research, but I'm alarmed that this research isn't even being done.",

The behavior *after* the initial attack is very different.  The vaccine can't replicate, so nothing at all happens, while the real virus goes wild and replicates like crazy in the time it has before the T and B cells get properly up to speed.

But bear in mind people get flu vaccine every year for decades and so far as I know no one's ever seen much of an effect.\n\nI'm generally baffled by why people expect vaccines to have effects far above, say, the things with which they routinely dose themselves,  like supplement vitamins or altering your diet in such-and-such a way, or drinking a lot of herbal tea.\n\nVaccines are by construction extraordinarily passive things.  They have no chemical activity at all, unlike almost any other small molecule drug or nutrient.  Modern vaccines (e.g. which don't contain whole viruses) contain nothing with biological activity, either -- e.g.  no functional proteins.\n\nIf they did not very closely resemble viral invader,  they would pretty much do nothing at all, it would  be like injecting yourself with saline, a tiny dot of fat, and a tiny dot of digested meat (for the DNA) every now and then.  Who would expect that to have much of an effect, let alone a long-term or serious effect?  I mean, it's not completely impossible -- almost nothing is completely impossible, who knew radon from the ground is responsible for much lung cancer? -- but it's just a strange kind of hypothesis to be first out of the gate.",

It makes all kinds of sense to base your judgment in no small part on your direct experience.  Even if there are good theoretical arguments why the COVID vax is very likely going to be harmless (and there are), an ounce of direct experience/measurement is always worth a pound or two of good theory :)\n\nMe, I will probably go get a booster relatively promptly when they're authorized.  My risk of a bad outcome from COVID is a little higher, and my personal professional background allows me to talk myself into believing I understand the risks and benefits well,  and that the booster represents a much lower risk than COVID itself.\n\nSo fortunately I am likely to go first, relative to you, and there will be millions like me, and hopefully by the time you *need* to make a decision, you'll have our experience as an additional source of useful information...if the booster kills me I'll see if I can log into ACX from Heaven and post a brief update for everyone's benefit...",

Smoking is probably not the ideal way to take it, but their advice wasn't that misguided.  In the 19th century, smoking probably was actually harmless or very close to it.  The health problems associated with smoking were not noticed until cheap, machine produced cigarettes were introduced.  Many deadly substances are only deadly in large enough doses.  Nobody smoked a pipe 20+ times a day.  Modern studies don't appear to show any negative health effects for pipe smokers.  It could very well be purely due to the dose, there's still no 2 pack a day equivalent pipe smokers.",

Suppose you do a half-assed study and it suggests drug X kinda-sort works for condition Y *and then it becomes the standard of care*.  How do you ethically go back and do the study right?  What's your moral argument for the existence of the control arm?  Informed consent is not going to cut it, not when the lawsuits flow.\n\nI think this is part of the sotto voce rationalization for the FDA's reluctance to approve things that maybe kinda sorta work but where the evidence is thin -- and you cited this yourself when it came to the aducanumab approval, and perhaps it's worth noting that  AD kills at a rate that isn't *that* far behind COVID.  Once you sort  of let the cat out of the bag, and a big constituency starts to exist for a therapy regimen, it becomes extremely difficult to go back and study it critically and precisely.  Even when it's ethical to do the study per se, meaning you can talk yourself (and others) into the ethical propriety of the control arm, there are political and sociological barriers that may be difficult to surmount.\n\nThere aren't any easy peasy solutions to this, I'm just pointing out that when we consider the interests, costs and benefits, of things like drug approval, I think as an enlightened society we are  obliged to consider the interests, costs and benefits, that will apply to future human beings because of what we do today.  It's not *just* about making our lives better, we need to consider whether a cost to us today will produce a significant benefit to those who come later (cf. global warming, right?) and take that into account also.   Information is not free: sometimes we have to pay for it in current lives, or misery, in order that the future has it and can trust it.",

I asked him to explain how ivermectin could possibly treat both an active viral infection *and* the damage to his organs he's experiencing in the medium-term aftermath. He was flummoxed. \n\nHe later came back and said that the PA's theory is that parasites \"acted up\" while his body was fending off the virus, and that parasites are causing his respiratory and digestive issues. Mind you, he lives in a wealthy part of Southern California, not Bangladesh. Has anyone ever made the case that long COVID = parasites? I don't know whether to laugh or cry.",

(If I'm wrong on the science, please let me know.) *Especially* when, as it appears to me, the people trying to do the convincing often view the non-vaxxed as having \"dumb\" beliefs and hold them in contempt.

Uncharitably, the people who want to force or convince everyone to become vaxxed (or to treat unvaxxed as second-class) solely want to exercise power.\n\nIs there a third option?\n",

This could hurt anyone including themselves if they need to go to hospital.\n- They are sorry for the overworked healthcare workers that have stress because of unnecessary cases. More general it is a waste of resources.\n\nSo i see plausible reasons why someone can have a strong opinion that everybody should be vaxxed. But people being missionary or even want to force everyone to be vaxxed are stupid on an other level: If you exercise pressure on people, expecially at such intimate things regarding the own body, will always earn resistance. If you want to convince someone you have to can present all your arguments but than you have to respect their free will.",

The most obvious is, for the sake of those who cannot take, or are not as well protected by, vaccines, including the very old, the very young, immunocompromised people like cancer patients, transplant patients, or those being treated for autoimmune disorders.  These people totally rely on \"herd immunity\" because they can't defend against the virus themselves, and can't use a vaccine to help them do so.\n\nThe second reason would be to reduce the social costs of the disease.  If the cost of ICU stays and very expensive interventions to try to save the life of a COVID patient were *only* borne by that patient, we could be fairly indifferent to whether he had himself taken steps to reduce the probability of him getting (very) sick.  But this is not the case, much of those costs are socialized, so that willy nilly means the preventative care decision necessarily gets socialized a bit, too.  You can't really have it both ways, you can't ask to make all your own health-care decisions because privacy *but* ask other people to pay for (a big part of) your health-care costs because humanity.",

Doesn't mean this is a *sufficient* reason -- maybe it's *not* going to work with COVID and its vaccines.  But if you have to bet, it's more reasonable to bet that COVID is like all the other viruses we know, and widespread use of an effective vaccine will result in herd immunity and a dramatically reduced risk to the immunocompromised.\n\nWith respect to the second, I've already agreed the most likely real  motive for most of the actual current passionate advocates, either way, is tribal loyalty signaling and a desire to stick it to the other guys.  I'm just arguing that simply because this is the most likely actual motive doesn't necessarily prove that it's the only motive for anybody, or that there aren't any legitimate motives at all.\n\nBut I'm also not sure what you mean by the distinction between young and old.  Young people certainly do visit grandma after her lung cancer surgery, or work as respiratory  therapists in hospitals treating immunocompromised patients (or socialize with other people who do).\n\nOne of the nasty consequences of a disease as readily transmissable as COVID is that it's really hard to erect sturdy barriers to transmission based on behavior and identity.  We were very lucky with other viruses in this camp, e.g. SARS-CoV-1 was much deadlier *but* wasn't very transmissable before symptoms, so you could just isolate the people who were obviously sick.   There were people who hoped that would work for SARS-CoV-2, i.e. just quarantine the sick and all will be well, but that turned out to be completely useless because it's so transmissable *before* symptoms appear.

But they also recognise that most people have moved on from COVID, so they've lifted almost all restrictions while keeping a few symbolic measures in place (e.g. in Wales you have to wear a mask on public transport but not in nightclubs or pubs). They also face a lot of pressure from the public health lobby (unions and NHS-related organisations). Masks, vaccine passports, and constantly reminding people that 'we're still in a global pandemic' placates these people while not costing much money.\n\nIMO England's Plan B and the indoor mask mandates/vaccine passports around Europe are basically the same thing, they're a signal that the government is doing something, placates public health bodies, and don't cost much money or annoy most people. I doubt many of these governments think these actually work that well.",

            "body": "Writing this while about 1/3 of the way through reading...\n\nA) Thank you so much for doing the yeoman's work to read through these carefully. This is what we pay you for (/s, lol)\n\nB) Regarding Babaloba et al, I tentatively think I may have found the solution:\n\n(This is the context)\n\n\"I think his point is that if you have 21 people, it‚Äôs impossible to have 50% of them have headache, because that would be 10.5. If 10 people have a headache, it would be 47.6%; if 11, 52%. So something is clearly wrong here. Seems like a relatively minor mistake, and Meyerowitz-Katz stops short of calling fraud, but it‚Äôs not a good look.\"\n\nWe have four columns - 1 for treatment A, B and control each, plus an overall. This allows us to triangulate to see what has happened with the data.\n\nColumn A is the mystery - how do you get 50% of 21 people, and so forth? Easy, have K people who have missing data for this outcome. Happens all the time. (In my research, I deal with much larger samples, but there's always missing values for some trivial % of the data). Technically you can have different numbers of missing by variable, but the easiest solution to make (at least a few) of these numbers work is to allow 1 person with missing data in Column A.\n\nThen we have 6/20 with fever, 10/20 = 50% with headache, and so forth. Columns B and C look fine. Ok, the question then is does my \"fix\" give the correct totals in the \"overall\" column? Turns out that (as far as I checked, it does)\n\nDetails: \nHeadache: 10/20 in col A, 12/21 in col B, 5/20 in col C. This would give 27/61 overall, which is 44.26%, which matches their 44.3% exactly.\nFever: 6/20 in col A, 9/21 in col B, 4/20 in col C. This would give 19/61 overall, which is 31.147%. They report 31.2%. This *doesn't quite match*. But if you round to 2 dp, you get 31.15%. And then if someone later rounds to 1 dp, you get (incorrectly) 31.2%. I bet errors like this happen all the time - you have your software print the result to 2 dp, and then as you write your table, you decide to do 1 dp and every time you have something end with \"5\" you don't go and check which way the raw data should round. (I bet I make this mistake in my research all the time when rounding coefficients and so forth manually in text, because who always remembers to stop and check?).\n\nHaven't checked the other variables, but getting these sufficiently close matches for the first two I checked for the most simple \"non-fraud\" explanation of \"1 data point missing\" seems too much of a fluke otherwise.",

Subunit vaccines just inject a chunk of protein that appears on the virus (Novavax is doing this), plus something to make your immune system pay attention.  Inactivated virus vaccines inject a virus that's been \"killed\" by heat or formaldehyde or something.  Attenuated live virus vaccines inject a form of the virus that has been adapted not to make you sick, so you get a mild asymptomatic infection and your immune system learns how to fight the real virus off.

There are also vaccines (I think almost all experimental) that just shoot DNA into you using some kind of air gun (or sometimes just injecting them, but they they need to do something to damage the cells to get the DNA inside).  I gather this works because the DNA makes it into some cells and its genes get expressed, but I don't really understand the mechanism very well.  Here's the Wikipedia article on them: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_vaccine ",

I see only two candidates - sincere belief in the effectiveness of Ivermectin or a profit motive. I don't believe trolls or nihilistic fraudsters would have that much motivation. Since the drug is already a generic drug, it would seem the profit motive is less likely than a sincere belief that it is an effective treatment for COVID19.\n\nI don't understand the intensity of the establishment backlash against Ivermectin. I have not seen evidence that vaccination rates would be higher if people did not believe ivermectin worked. Nor do I think that it's intuitively clear that this would be the case. People who distrust the establishment don't trust them on vaccines or on whether or not ivermectin works. Even if they were somehow convinced that ivermectin didn't work, they wouldn't trust the vaccines unless the public health establishment suddenly became more trustworthy overall. Add to this the fact that if taken in human sized doses, ivermectin is safe and I don't really see the reason for the virulent mainstream backlash. In fact, the backlash probably cost some lives by causing people to take crazy dosages. \n\nMore generally, I don't understand the establishment messaging of vaccines (+masks) or you're the worst. There are plenty of other ways to reduce risk including doing things to maintain or improve overall health (exercise and sunlight). And these activities are not mutually exclusive with taking vaccines. The messaging should not have been anti vaccine alternative - that just spreads distrust. It should have been vaccines are good and here's a bunch of other positive steps you might take to reduce your COVID19 risk. And the evidence for ivermectin is mixed, but if your doctor wants to give you some, whatever its harmless.  Again, I think the vaccine or bust messaging was really counterproductive. ",

Certain morally valent policy recommendations are sufficiently morally incorrect as to constitute  evil behavior. Censoring the net is evil. Convincing depressed teens and twentysomethings to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to have their genitals mutilated and rendered permanently nonorgasmic, in an intervention that is sold as preventing suicide but is ineffective even at that, is evil. Advocating for the normalization of sexual relationships between mature adults and people too young to give informed consent,  and the concomitant power imbalance, is evil. Advocating for the legalization of the murder of viable fetuses is evil. All of these are mainstream positions within the Democratic party and the broader academic left from which the Democratic party draws its social policy recommendations. When I claim the Democratic party is evil, I am not dunking on the outgroup. I have specific and grave moral concerns about their specific and openly held social policy recommendations.",

(You happen to be wrong, but it's defensible.). \n\nIt makes some sense to go after them for the genital stuff next. There's at least something in there about \"medically necessary care for gender transition\" that you could attempt to hang your hat on. It's going to be a real stretch to get to \"objectively evil\" but I would at least read your attempt.\n\nWhen you bring up net censorship, I have no idea what you're talking about. I am going to charitably assume you aren't talking about twitter and facebook banning Trump. When I ctrl-f for \"internet\" I find \"an open internet, including net neutrality\". I'm quite willing to believe there's something dumb about the internet in there, because everyone says dumb things about the internet, but you'll have to call it out specifically, and then make a case for why it's evil instead of just dumb.\n\nBut you completely tank your credibility with the pedophilia.

For a normal response, most of us would never have heard of ivermectin and the medical profession would have worked through the studies and made recommendations to doctors.  Individual people would have heard positives or negatives about the drug from their doctor, and made up their own mind.  Nothing special, no big deal.  ",

But still, if you're ignoring a working vaccine to take snake oil, you're being silly and I'm not going to feel bad that people make fun of you.\n\nOf course you're right that we should be exercising more, eating better, etc., to prevent covid, but we should also be wearing surgical masks and ventilating indoor spaces. We don't need to choose between air bags and seat belts. \n\n\nThe vaccine might justify taking fewer cautions since it's simply way more effective than any NPI, but there's nothing else that compares. I might even trade in all our messaging on NPIs for messaging that boosts vaccinations, given that the marginal value of an additional vaccination is so much higher.",

We know Rogan promoted stuff that didn't work, presuming that we both read the post we're commenting on. So what led to this failure? What could he do better? If taking reasonable steps to prevent yourself from platforming false information doesn't work, then what can you do from there?

Promotion requires a certain level of encouragement for others to follow suit, which hasn't happened here to the best of my knowledge.\n\nYour conclusion that this was some kind of failure hinges on this distinction, but I don't think it holds. Rogan invites experts with wildly varying opinions to speak on all sorts of subjects.

It's very weird to me that people are willing to accept a status quo where major institutions and figures get big questions wrong on a factual basis and no one seems that concerned about how to stop these misses.\"\n\nI think this is the challenge of the time, and also just a side effect of the scientific process. We don't get things 100% right, and we also don't seem to have anyone owning up to that. Instead, they move on and pretend they didn't say that wrong thing they said (rightfully as much as our major institutional figures do as they set the example!). As Scott said, I think one of the solutions is standardizing the publishing of raw data. \n\nThat'll hopefully speed up the process between when a false interpretation of data is posted and when its corrected.",

Are you more willing to listen to someone who admits their faults, but puts their understanding out there to review, or someone who claims to be right and doubles down on the incorrectness before hurriedly trying to memory hole it?  \n\nProbably the biggest reason I read ACX is that Scott is willing to consider opposing views and admit when he's wrong.  Joe Rogan does that much better than the CDC.  I still care more what the CDC says than what Rogan says, but it's close enough that I can understand people who go the other way.  ",

But my understanding of what happened with Rogan was that he was not vaccinated because he felt that he was healthy and did not need it.  Then he contracted COVID.  Then he contacted a doctor that he had had on the show  who supposedly had a bunch of treatments for folks who had COVID.  He paid that doctor a lot of money to recommend/proscribe him a bunch of stuff of which Ivermectin was one thing along with monoclonal antibodies.  Once he recovered he mentioned on his show the laundry list of stuff he took.  Then the media jumped on the fact that he took Ivermectin and said he took horse dewormer.\n\nI don't think Rogan was actively promoting Ivermectin as an alternate to vaccination before or after he got COVID",

My point was that if Biden hadn't paused the rollout, Rogan would have gotten his J&J, and maybe as a result he'd be more positive on the vaccines.\n\nOf course, if you personally don't think people should get the vaccine, then you're presumably fine with how things worked out, and I won't argue with you about that point. I think people should get vaccinated, so the fact that Biden administration policy indirectly led to the biggest talk show host in the country landing on the skeptic side was a huge unforced error for Team Get People Vaccinated.",

So obviously the CDC are anti-vaxxers, right?  This is not some slight exaggeration, it is a complete and total lie.  Pointing out the objective fact that some subset of people have no compelling reason to get a specific vaccine is not in any way comparable to being an \"anti-vaxxer\".

Isn't that a reasonable stance, if that person decides to take the risk of getting Covid and then treating it if it gets bad? \n\nThere is a n% chance that you get Covid, an n% chance that it is symptomatic and an n% chance that it is serious. Depending on who you are, getting all the way to it getting bad is pretty slim. A vaccine helps you in the case that all of these are true, whereas if there is an effective therapy, which there is, then I think people should be able to take the risk of getting Covid and then treating it.",

So, ivermectin (which seems to have fizzed out) made sense as something to test for the same reason fluvoxamine (which seems to work) did; well-tolerated in-production drugs with effects on inflammation systems (since inflamation is a factor in COVID).\n\nA whole bunch of other drugs that fit that general description have been tested, too, without making the news; that's because they failed (unlike fluvoxamine) without any faked studies declaring them a major success (unlike ivermectin).\n\nAs far as the psychology on the pro- side, it looks like the usual confirmation bias. People saw the studies where it had a major effect and were convinced, and have held to that regardless.\n\nAnd on the anti- side, the invective is the usual tribalist animosity signaling.

She did ultimately decide she was more scared of COVID and got the vaccine.\n\nNow if you are scared of COVID and vaccine, and Team Ivermectin tells you not to be worried about COVID because their pill will protect you, that should make you less likely to get the vaccine. I'm not a huge fan of \"risk-compensation\" arguments against imperfect interventions because it's rare people risk compensate more than the benefits of the imperfect intervention, but here the benefit is probably zero so any risk compensation is harmful.",

No idea if she was terminated or stormed out. They were sent to the dept mailing list, then followed by a sorry disregard email. I think they're illustrative of what a lot of us think of the anti-covid-vax / pro-invermectin crowd, and of what that crowd thinks of us. I don't know what there is to do, or where we go from here.\n\n\"In the US, the Supreme Court has ruled that vaccinated people worldwide are products, patented goods, according to US law, no longer human. Through a modified DNA or RNA vaccination, the mRNA vaccination, the person ceases to be human and becomes the OWNER of the holder of the modified GEN vaccination patent, because they have their own genome and are no longer \"human\" (without natural people), but \"trans-human\", so a category that does not exist in Human Rights. The quality of a natural person and all related rights are lost. This applies worldwide and patents are subject to US law. Since 2013, all people vaccinated with GM-modified mRNAs are legally trans-human and legally identified as trans-human and do not enjoy any human or other rights of a state, and this applies worldwide, because GEN-POINT technology patents are under US jurisdiction and law, where they were registered. SOURCE of the decision of the US SUPREME COURT PDF HERE (https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-398_1b7d.pdf) To follow how / if it applies to others, outside the US.\"\n\nAnd\n\n\"Reasons why the jab cannot be mandatory and why not to take it This is 100% ILLEGAL. 1) there was to be a full experiments done on testing animals FIRST. When ALL the animals DIED, they stopped the experiments ! ***They are REQUIRED to explore all options to see if there already is an approved therapy on the market BEFORE even making jabs... Ivermectin and HQC were two that were acceptable. But they demonized doctors who used those safer therapies and banned their use, thus many lives were lost in the process !!! Also, Fauci had a contract with Moderna back in 2015 I think. Mass amounts of PCR tests were also sent world wide between 2017 and 2019... Event 201was held in October 2019 simulating a corona virus pandemic... Boom - then we have one ! Not coincidental or suspicious at all ??!!! Fauci had also written a paper how the two therapies above were great in treating the SARS virus as a treatment and cure .... 2) This is NOT FDA approved. It is under the Emergency Authorization Act as an \"Experimental GENE THERAPY Injection... It is NOT even a vaccine ! 3) By not going through ALL the protocols set by the Nuremberg Trials, they are breaking the Nuremberg Laws !!! 4) A drug CANNOT be mandated that has NOT been approved by the FDA. And that is not saying it is safe even then - look at all the commercials for lawsuits against FDA treatments all night long on your tv... 5) Why would anyone want to take a product where the manufacturers are NOT LIABLE for any deaths or injury ? If they are not willing to stand behind it, it is defective at best and nefarious at worst. 6) The clinical trials are not even done until 2023... We are the lab rats ! They won't even list all the bad stuff until the trials are finished !!! But we see all the deaths, injuries and diseases that these jabs are giving people, and they still line up for it AND make their CHILDREN get it !! Children have not been tested for this yet ! 7) If your employer makes this mandatory for you or anyone else, they too could be subject to breaking the Nuremberg Laws. One of the penalties is EXECUTION for breaking any one of these Laws. The employers also are 100% liable for any injury or death you may have ...not the manufacturers. Remind them of this when they want you to take the jab....especially the execution part. NOTE - If you or anyone knows of someone injured or died, contact PJI.Org On their site they have a PDF about your rights with this whole hot mess, and they can represent you for free.  If you die or get injured, your insurance may refuse to pay ANY BENEFITS due to you knowingly got involved in what they term as Risky Behavior... Like some one jumping out of a plane without a parachute .. So say goodbye to all that money you paid into your burial and health insurance... 9) These jabs do NOT prevent you from getting the virus in fact, more people get the virus directly after the jab . They also then shed the virus onto non vaxxed people. Unvaxxed are exposed to vaxxed are experiencing miscarriages, changes in their menstrual cycles for the women, and other things are popping up. The vaxxed are dying from the Delta varient in more numbers than the unvaxxed... 10) During the Senate Committee Corona Virus hearings, they had various doctors that were highly educated speaking about how dangerous these are and that there has been more deaths and injuries from these jabs than with all the other approved vaccines in history COMBINED, that they should have been pulled with just the first couple of deaths and injuries... LINKS to the brave doctors testifying https://youtu.be/mIPb0AtEvAE https://youtu.be/MGboD4KAgbM 11) The CDC was recently caught removing a large amount of jab injuries and deaths on their VAERS website. It has been estimated that 150 THOUSAND people have died from the jabs. So I have given just some of the facts as to why people may not choose to get this. It isn't that they are anti-vaxxers, They are just Pro Life !!! KNOW YOUR RIGHTS ! I made that so people have a defense when getting attacked by people or employer This was created by Brenda Purvis https://www.newsbreakapp.com/n/0auna1tA?share_id=eyJ1c2VyaWQiOjQ5MTUyMDIxLCJkb2NfaWQiOiIwYXVuYTF0QSIsInRpbWVzdGFtcCI6MTYyNjI4MTE3MTIyN30=&s=a7&pd=03KEgXnK&hl=en_US&lp=v2\"\n\n",

Most people are pretty bad at this, probably journalists and politicians are mostly very bad at this, and to be honest, almost nobody is really good at it.  \n\nThere's also a moralistic/tribal mode of thinking, where you are following norms yourself, enforcing norms on others, denouncing shirkers and wreckers, etc.  This is easy--our brains are evolved for this kind of game, it's fun, it's accessible to the dumbest and least educated people.  Probably journalists and politicians are extra good at this game.  \n\nAlmost from the beginning of covid, most mainstream people with prominent voices/platforms were playing the moralistic/tribal game.  Racism is the real virus.  Get a load of these weird aspie racist techbros wearing masks and using hand sanitizer.  Sanitize surfaces and wash your hands!  Masks are only for medical personnel.  The lab leak hypothesis is racist and must be suppressed.  Joe Rogan's taking horse dewormer.  \n\nA few people were playing the rational game, but they were mostly not the people with the biggest megaphones.

Delete EVERYTHING you believe. EVERYTHING. Scrap it ALL.\n\nVaccines do not - and NEVER HAVE - prevented all infections. Ever.\n\nWhat they do is greatly lower transmission.\n\nFor a disease to proliferate in the population, it needs to infect at least one person per person it infects. A disease that fails to do so will gradually die out.\n\nA vaccine that lowers transmission rates by an order of magnitude will cripple the spread of a disease, and result in it declining in the population.\n\nYour FALSE belief that vaccines provide 100% immunity is causing you to create an alternate universe where you are creating nonsense and inserting it into things.\n\nYes, immunity wanes - but the word \"rapidly\" appears nowhere in what he said. That was something you hallucinated, you inserted it in because you NEED it to be true.\n\nBreakthroughs are not about preventing transmission to other people per se, but actually getting sick if you are vaccinated. And, again, everyone knew that there were going to be breakthrough infections - no vaccine is ever 100% effective against illness.\n\nVaccines can and do require boosters. Many do, in fact. We had no idea whether or not we would require them for COVID. We know we do now, and are getting them, and they boost immunity and reduce infection rates.\n\nYour belief is that vaccines do not prevent all infections and are therefore worthless. But that is wrong. Vaccines have never prevented all infections. What they do is greatly reduce the risk of infection.\n\nThis has been pointed out time and again and again.\n\nYou don't understand the basics, and get very upset and start raging out when you are confronted on them.\n\nYou don't want to admit you are wrong, and have such a bad case of confirmation bias you are making up things and inserting them into things.",

Current evidence is that they lower the chance of infection, but by a good deal less than one order of magnitude. Different sources give different estimates for how contagious someone who has been vaccinated but is infected is, with some finding that there is no significant difference.\n\nElsewhere in your comments you use \"Fauci says\" as if it were a strong argument. Fauci is on record, in a NYT interview, saying that what he says is changed by what he expects people to believe, that he is raising his estimate of the requirement for herd immunity in response to polling evidence on people's willingness to get vaccinated. That is an admission that his public statements are sometimes lies ‚Äî from his standpoint, virtuous lies.

Not them magically not being infectious if they DO get sick. I'd expect people who get sick to be infectious; why WOULDN'T they be?\n\nThat's a nonsensical argument. The only plausible way would be lower viral load, which I suppose is potentially true, but a lot of the time, lower viral load = asymptomatic infection = people don't even realize that they were infected to begin with.\n\nAnd as for Fauci - you assume that I am worshipping him or something. I am well aware that he is a public spokesman.\n\nThe actual figure is probably north of 90%. Probably more like 95%.\n\nWhile I agree that he shouldn't have been downplaying the necessary rate, I get why he said it.",

Meanwhile MMR had not eliminated measles.\n\nOne major reason why: measles is much more contagious than Polio or Smallpox.\n\nLikewise, Delta-variant COVID is more contagious than either Smallpox or Polio was.\n\nWhen there are measles outbreaks, people who are vaccinated against measles still get measles sometimes. They get it at a lower rate, but they can and do still get it.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why herd immunity is so important - because with highly contagious diseases, getting vaccinated is not complete protection.\n\nYou need to have north of 95% of the population vaccinated against Measles to limit its spread.\n\nThe same is true of COVID.\n\nIf you understood this stuff at all, you'd understand this.\n\nBut alas, you do not.",

Compare google's results to other search engines for the same searches.  Claiming \"oh we're censoring facts we don't like because we know better than you what you should read\" does not make it some benevolent act.  If I use google, I can not find Dr. Ozaki explaining his recommendation for doctors to conduct clinical trials on ivermectin.  If I use a search engine that does not censor facts for the US government, I can find both written articles quoting him, as well as the video of him originally giving the press release.  The only reason for this discrepancy is the government/media complex's disinfo campaign about ivermectin.  They simply do not want people to see the truth, that real doctors have genuinely recommended standard, safe, properly conducted, clinical trials for ivermectin.  Real recommendations have been \"we should do clinical trials on this, because the epidemiological data suggests it could have a benefit\".  This contradicts their narrative that ivermectin is unsafe livestock medication baselessly recommended solely by evil far right russian trump nazi terrorist klansmen radio hosts.",

It is time to move on.\nI just Googled the term \"dr. ozaki ivermectin\" and I got a page full of results linking to articles talking about how the problems with Dr Ozaki's research.\nUsing DuckDuckGo, I see the top 3 results do support Dr Ozaki, but are sources of no repute - anyone can create a wordpress page,  and why would I go to \"christianitydaily\" (top result) who cites \"lifesite news\" for information on the matter?\nGoogle has vastly more resources to vet the search results that DuckDuckGo does.

I have a hard time finding any way to charitably interpret your comments as being misguided or mistaken rather than deliberately dishonest.\n\n>I just Googled the term \"dr. ozaki ivermectin\" and I got a page full of results linking to articles talking about how the problems with Dr Ozaki's research.\n\nHe did not do any research.  He made a recommendation to doctors, to consider conducting clinical trials, based on the research other scientists have done.  The fact that you can't determine what he did from a google search is the problem.\n\n>I see the top 3 results do support Dr Ozaki,\n\nWe're not looking for \"support\", we're looking for honest representation of objective fact.  Or simply the actual video of him actually speaking the words he actually said, instead of \"journalists\" openly lying about what he said and did.\n\nGoogle \"vetting\" search results is not a benefit, as google ARE bad actors.  You are dismissing objective reality as wrong, because the place you found a reference to reality could hypothetically be manipulated by bad actors, yet the place where you can only find outright lies is good, because you already know for certainty that it is being manipulated by bad actors.  That is not a logical position.\n\nDig deeper and find the video and watch it.  He is just a doctor in an advisory position, who made a simple and completely uncontroversial recommendation that doctors should do clinical trials on an already approved drug, for a new off label use.  This happens every single day.  This was before several of the trials in Scott's analysis had been conducted.  The fact that there is an entire huge media operation dedicated to lying about this, and suppressing the evidence of it is the issue, not whether or not the clinical trials being recommended would end up finding ivermectin beneficial in the future when they were conducted.  He is a doctor, not a time traveller.",

We blew it because people refused to come together as a society and work on the problem - refused to wear masks, refused to self-isolate, refused to social distance, refused to endorse policies we knew could reduce the spread of the disease.  We all know people who have died as a result of this failure - and people who will continue to suffer, and die, because of this failure.\n\nThere is a ton of anger just floating around because of this.  Is it 100% rational to point this anger at the ivermectin people?  To the extent that they're taking ivermectin because they refused the vaccine and then got covid, yes, it is justified to be angry at them for putting themselves and their families and their communities at risk.  To the extent that they are putting forth a good faith effort to ameliorate the suffering and death, no, maybe some of the derision isn't justified - but again, remember, in many cases what they're trying to ameliorate is a direct consequence of their own bad choices.  No one (to my knowledge) is saying doctors shouldn't study ivermectin (or HCQ or anything else) - rather, the backlash is against people who refused the preventative measures that we know would have worked, and are now desperate enough to try for a Hail Mary the effectiveness of which is very much in doubt.\n\nI don't believe in punishing people for mistakes as a general principle, but I sure am angry that so many people decided to just let COVID get out-of-control bad (and are still doing so, in many places in the world).  Sometimes I have very dark thoughts like \"if all the anti-vaxxers died then at least covid would finally be over\" and I have to remind myself that while this would satisfy my lizard-brain urge for revenge, it wouldn't be the basis for any sort of morally correct decision-making.  And ironically it is this refusal to allow myself to will the death of anti-vaxxers that makes me in favor of vaccine mandates, which in turn prompts anti-vaxxers to compare me to Hitler, who famously bent over backwards to try to prevent the deaths of his ideological opponents.  So that's what we get for being nice.\n\nSo, I would contradict your post, and say that the fact that the most we're seeing is a bunch of jokes about horse-paste is an indication that the \"establishment\" is fantastically good at bottling up its righteous rage and fury.  The fact that the Herman Cain Award reddit only has 400K members is actually a sign of our society's maturity.  In previous times, people who were suspected of spreading deadly plagues were driven out of society entirely, so we're actually being much nicer to anti-vaxxers than the expected baseline, and also much nicer than they're being to us in return.",

But we have plenty of anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers.\n\nI have publicly criticized the Georgian government for its role in screwing up the response, and also for delaying vaccine approval for kids, which would have allowed my children to have a normal school year this year.  We know from other countries that the vaccines (Sinopharm in particular) are perfectly safe for children of all ages - UAE has been vaccinating kids 3 and up, for example.\n\nThat said if I lived in the US I would indeed be mad as heck at the FDA about that and other delays.  I believe Zvi regularly posts about how awful the FDA has been throughout this whole thing.\n\nNone of which changes the fact that anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers and \"herd immunity\" and \"focused protection\" advocates have all also contributed to this crisis and many continue to do so even after the most sclerotic bureaucracies have course-corrected.",

That's crazy.\n\nIt shows just how ridiculously infectious COVID is by comparison - measures inadequate to fully control COVID were sufficient to lower flu deaths by 99%.",

An unknown portion of those \"COVID\" cases were flu cases.  Nobody was tested for flu, everyone was tested for COVID, and here in Canada 100% of the COVID tests done last year were completely worthless PCR tests with insanely high cycle counts.  A test with a 97% false positive rate is worse than no test.  And it forms the foundation of this entire mass hysteria.",

South Korea had universal drive-through covid testing and tracked every case; the US had nurses duct-taping garbage bags over their clothes because hospitals ran out of PPE while the FDA held up testing for months for no reason.  Is logistical and medical incompetence somehow baked into the fabric of the US, in a way that is so obvious that you feel absolutely no need to point out how the US differs from countries with competent pandemic responses?\n\nFor a few years after I left the US I was surprised when governments did things that were clearly good and clearly worked, so I get where you're coming from.  But the idea that the US can't do basic things that other countries can do easily is the dangerous delusion.  It's killed almost a million Americans in this pandemic alone.  That's because it's a self-fulfilling prophecy: \"the government can't do anything good\" therefore you kill any attempt by the government to do anything good therefore the government doesn't do anything good, thus \"proving\" the initial point.  Meanwhile, other governments do tons of good stuff and the rest of the world looks at the US and goes \"what's up with them?\"",

Whatever country \"we\" is, managed that just fine.\n\n>We blew it because people refused to come together as a society and work on the problem - refused to wear masks, refused to self-isolate, refused to social distance, refused to endorse policies we knew could reduce the spread of the disease.\n\nBut we know all of that is complete BS.  The anger is floating around precisely because so many people live in the TV fabricated alternate reality where that nonsense is true.  They somehow forget that at the beginning, when we had no concrete information to go on, republicans were the ones taking COVID seriously, and dems were insisting it is \"just the flu\" and organizing \"hug a random asian person because the imaginary racism we just made up is the real disease\" events.  Dems were the ones insisting masks don't work and you are an evil panic spreading fear monger if you wear one.  And then as we got real information from countries with slightly more trustworthy governments than China's, and we determined that it really is just the flu and there is no need to do anything, everything suddenly reversed and we had always been at war with Eastasia.\n\nWe knew from the time of the great reversal, once efforts to restrict travel to prevent spread had been successfully shut down by \"racism\" accusations, that it had become endemic and it was going to be a permanent disease like the flu.  This was openly explained to all of you, when you were told that we needed temporary 2 week measures to \"flatten the curve\" and not overwhelm our health care systems with too many cases at once, since there was nothing we could do to change the number of cases that would happen overall.  And yet, on week 89 of 2 weeks to flatten the curve, people are somehow able to delude themselves into blocking all of this out of their head, while simultaneously remaining completely convinced of their own superior, skeptical mind.",

The US has far more people with serious health problems than Japan does.  We know age and co-morbidities are the most important factors in COVID deaths by several orders of magnitude.  And denying the lack of seriousness of COVID is just silly.  Look up the average age of COVID death victims yourself.  It is higher than the average life expectancy.  Look at the survival rate for people below 80 without co-morbidities.  COVID is killing people 3 weeks sooner than they would have died anyways from something else.  Many COVID deaths are admittedly not even COVID deaths, they are deaths within a selected time window of having a positive PCR test for COVID.",

They believe that ivermectin works, but it's not something they are unbiased about.\n\nThis group has also decided that covid vaccines are net bad for most of the population, and are hyping ivm as an alternative to vaccines, along with accusations against establishments re: why they promote vaccines but not ivm.

            "body": "This is the single best article written on ivermectin throughout the whole pandemic. Thank you.\n\nI've been looking at ivermectin since the early months of the pandemic. I had heard of the I-MASK+ protocol when people were still using ventilators on COVID patients (with an 85% death rate in NYC), and it sounded really promising to me. So I've been really open-minded as to whether or not it actually worked.\n\nBut over the next several months, and now 18+ months later, it never really succeeded in having a home run in terms of proving that it worked. I don't think we need medication that decreases viral load 3 days faster, we need medication that keeps people out of the hospital and from dying. It was pretty clear anecdotally that ivermectin wasn't doing that. \n\nI think basically it comes down to the fact that when you have a disease where 85% of people suffering no or only mild symptoms and 0.5% death, it's going to be a very hard disease to determine if a treatment worked or not.\n\nI think the science we have been doing over the course of the pandemic has been largely garbage because we haven't learned anything to help us whatsoever since March 2020. If I remember correctly, the mRNA vaccine was designed within days of the virus being sequenced in January. The rest of the time on the vaccine was spent making sure it was safe, but you can argue that nothing new was learned after the vaccine was created. Since then, we haven't really learned anything about the virus, about the transmission, how to fight it, etc. Our best bet is to wear masks and stay outdoors, which we already knew.\n\nWhat we as a species really need is a global mobilization of scientists, where a single global committee designs a thousands of different experiments that would help us narrow down how the virus works and how to fight it, and divvy up the work globally. We could have worked in parallel doing thousands of experiments to help us figure out what exactly we need to do to beat COVID, but instead the millions of scientists around the world were trying to determine if SARS-CoV-2 was found in vaginal fluid or semen.

Yes, in the last couple of weeks there have been pills that came out that cut the risk by 85% which is finally what we need. But aside from finding those drugs, we don't know why it causes severe symptoms in some people, and almost no symptoms in most people. Is it genetic? We have no idea, but it's been 2 years and we don't know. We don't know why many people lose their sense of smell. We don't fully understand the mechanism of transmission. The only definitive thing we know is that as the age of the person increases, the chance of severe symptoms and death rises exponentially, but we don't know why. We don't know why kids are largely immune to COVID. We don't know why some people are dying of blood clots, although there was a recent study saying that the spike protein may interfere with some parts of the clotting process.\n\nThere's so much we don't know. The medications like fluvoxamine give a percentage improvement but it's not a home run like the Pfizer drug. I would classify that as a statistical modifier rather than a real medical treatment. We need something akin to penicillin that effective solves bacterial infection, we don't need things that only provide statistical significance to moderately improving symptoms over a large number of people.",

You moved me from the ‚ÄúIVM probably works a little‚Äù basket to the ‚ÄúIVM probably doesn‚Äôt work‚Äù basket. \n\nI do think there‚Äôs a few points you could add to your analogy that seem fairly important to the more educated and knowledgeable vaccine hesitant people I know:\n\n- Previous brain implants have gone through long trial periods to ensure they don‚Äôt cause adverse effects. However, the aliens believe the quantum memetic plague constitutes an emergency and there isn‚Äôt time for such a process. Plus they say the early trial results look great. \n\n- The first implants start getting inserted and some rare side effects are noticed. In the worst cases, some of the implanted die as a result. The aliens insist there‚Äôs nothing to worry about, as it‚Äôs a very rare occurrence. But you can‚Äôt help wondering if they‚Äôre investigating the problem in good faith. \n\n- A few months into the program the implants stop working as well as promised. The memetic plague has mutated, and found new ways around the implants. The aliens acknowledge this but maintain it changes nothing of practical importance. Herd immunity to the memes may no longer be possible. \n\n- Anyone promoting vaccines in public is censored. On some platforms, even non-promotional discussion of vaccine efficacy is targeted.\n\n- A few more months pass and the aliens decide that implants will be mandatory, and refusal will mean you cannot use any alien technology! Alien tech has already permeated all of earth life. They‚Äôre also implanting children, who were supposed to be almost unaffected by the memetic plague. The brief explanations are difficult to parse, and seem somewhat circular to the human mind.",

Imagine that a group of human bureaucrats had studied the alien biochips, approved some after a long process and refused to approve others, but all the material evidence was that the biochips worked better than expected. The only bumps in the administrative processes are when the bureaucrats blame one biochip for an unrelated problem and make it illegal to use for a brief period. We get evidence even months later than breaking the chips in half confers the same level of protection, even though the bureaucratic process made that difficult to study. Have I totally killed this metaphor yet?",

I seem to recall there was a major Right-wing conspiracy theory about Obama not being born in the US that was started by ... the Hillary Clinton campaign. I know that wasn't the first instance of this happening, and there have been a few that were directly science-related, but that's the first that comes to mind.\n\nI don't like the narrative of Left=scientific/Right=mystic, because it doesn't fit my actual experience. As an actual immunologist who is not intensely miserable, I find enough voodoo mysticism to go around on both sides. What's fascinating to me is how the voodoo can easily cross the aisle when politics shift.",

How does Trump lying about how many doses would be ready by what date make any of the statements made by Harris, Biden or Cuomo acceptable?  There is no context that makes these statements responsible or honest unless their current position is irresponsible and dishonest.  The same vaccines made and approved by the same people through the same processes do not become dangerous or safe based on political whims.  Either we should be wary and skeptical of the rushed vaccines then and now, or we should \"trust the science\", shutup and take them then and now.\n\nInterviewer: \"Let's just say there's a vaccine that is approved and even distributed before the election, would you get it?\"\nHarris: \"Well, I think that's going to be an issue for all of us. I will say that I would not trust Donald Trump.\"\n\nBiden: \"If and when a vaccine comes, its not likely to go through all the tests that needs to be and the trials that are needed to be done.\"\n\nBiden: \"Who's going to take the shot? Are you going to be the first one to say sign me up?\"\n\nCuomo: \"You‚Äôre going to say to the American people now, ‚ÄòHere‚Äôs a vaccine, it was new, it was done quickly, but trust this federal administration and their health administration that it‚Äôs safe? And we‚Äôre not 100 percent sure of the consequences.‚Äô I think it‚Äôs going to be a very skeptical American public about taking the vaccine, and they should be.‚Äù\n\nCuomo: ‚ÄúFrankly, I‚Äôm not going to trust the federal government‚Äôs opinion, and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend [it] to New Yorkers, based on the federal government‚Äôs opinion.‚Äù\n\nAll three of them knowingly and deliberately made it seem like there was something wrong with the vaccines before they knew anything about them and that people should avoid them simply because Trump exists.  And looking at old twitter posts from before the election, it certainly worked.  Thousands of dems tweeted about how they would never take the unsafe, rushed, \"so-called\" vaccine that Trump was dangerously and irresponsibly pushing.",

And in some jurisdictions you have to annually prove you got a flu shot to work in health care.  \n\nAs for travel--you haven't lived through a raging respiratory pandemic before, so no, nobody ever asked for proof of immunizations for routine travel.  That said, when my daughter went to school in France before the pandemic broke out, she had to present immunization records in order to get a student visa.  And foreign students who come to the US for college also must present proof of several immunizations--a practice that substantially predates this pandemic.",

You do not need to attend a public school to get educated, and there is a strong argument that doing so will in fact seriously hinder you from getting educated.  You do not need to be vaccinated for typical work or travel.  Since COVID is not a dangerous disease, and the people trying to mandate vaccination against it openly say that they hate me and want me dead, and are also trying to mandate all sorts of idiotic things that are clearly not for health reasons, it is pretty rational to be skeptical of such vaccine mandates.",

In that survey, about 80% consistently agree ‚ÄúThe continents on which we live have been moving their locations for millions of years and will continue to move in the future.‚Äù Ten percent say they don‚Äôt know, leaving only about 10% rejecting continental drift over millions of years. Though young-earth creationists often latch onto continental drift as a sudden process during Noah‚Äôs flood (as a way to explain how animals could get from the Ark to separate continents), they certainly don‚Äôt think the continents moved over millions of years. This question puts a cap of about 10% on the number of committed young-earth creationists, lower even than what Bishop found. More people in the NSB science literacy survey didn‚Äôt know that the father‚Äôs genes determine the sex of a baby, thought all radioactivity came from human activities, or disagreed that the earth goes around the sun.\n\nIn short, then, the hard core of young-earth creationists represents at most one in ten Americans‚Äîmaybe about 31 million people‚Äîwith another quarter favoring creationism but not necessarily committed to a young earth. One or two in ten seem firmly committed to evolution, and another third leans heavily toward evolution. About a third of the public in the middle are open to evolution, but feel strongly that a god or gods must have been involved somehow, and wind up in different camps depending how a given poll is worded.\"",

Depends on what you mean.\n\nAlso, almost all Christians say that the bible is true, and might say the account of creation is \"true,\" but only biblical literalism says that it's \"*literally* true\", and even then, what literally means in this context is a bit fuzzy. And despite all of that, I strongly suspect that even most people who would say that the bible is literally true would also say that the earth is billions of years old if asked the question on a survey that was clearly not about religion, because framing.",

I recall finding that it either shared a server or owner with FLCCC. \n\nCaution, my memory may not be serving correctly:\n\nI may have looked up information about FLCCC the same night, but I am quite sure my inquiries were at different times. \n\nI may have connected them, because the \"meta\" and \"C19\" sites link to FLCCC.\n\nI don't remember enough detail to give to say definitively what it was I saw that made me sure of a connection. \n\nWith the caveats out of the way, I will say I have high confidence that this site is indeed related to the Alliance.\n\nBut most alarming in my view is that there are identical sites for HCQ and Vitamin D. And the analyses appear to show similar levels of effectiveness as IVM.\n\nI've been called both a BigPharma apologist/corporate shill and a pinko by anti-vaxers since the pandemic started. I'm certainly much closer to the latter, but it illustrates how generic heuristics can override judgement by otherwise rational people. ",

            "body": "Scott, I really appreciate this careful review of the data on ivermectin. While it mostly matches what I already thought about the subject, it presents it much more clearly and carefully than anywhere else I have seen.\n\nWhich is why I'm so baffled that you are so confident that the covid vaccines are safe and effective that you don't even feel the need to present an analysis of the studies on the subject, and instead went with this analogy about aliens. Even though the Pfizer study to get FDA approval was just shown to be partially based on falsified data, and the all cause mortality was higher in the vaccine arm than the placebo arm. Even though the trial for children 5-11 did not show any clinical benefit at all (because no one had any serious outcomes in either arm). Even though no one has demonstrated any population level association between vaccination rate in a state or country and covid rate.\n\nI really, truly wish I was as convinced as you seem to be that the vaccines are safe and effective. But it doesn't match my personal experience, and what I'm seeing in the world around me. I know that one shouldn't base one's epistemology on personal anecdotes, but I haven't found the studies on this subject nearly as reassuring as I would have hoped. I see everyone dismissing the sudden spike in VAERS reports because causation can't be proven--but why would the rate of reports suddenly increase so much compared to previous vaccines? All the papers I've seen about VAERS prior to covid suggest that it almost certainly underreports the true rate of adverse events from vaccines rather than overreporting them.\n\nI know it's a huge, probably impossible ask, but if you could find the time to try to dig into this subject, I would be truly, deeply grateful. I want to be convinced, and I believe that I can be convinced that the vaccines are safe and effective (I actually am vaccinated, but based on the research I have done since then, I regret it and don't want to get the booster). I see vaccine denialists making obvious errors and exaggerations, but I also see them pointing out what seem to me to be serious flaws and shortcomings in the studies supporting vaccination. I'm not saying I think the vaccines are definitely unsafe/ineffective, but especially for young healthy people who are at low risk for covid, I'm not seeing the convincing case that getting vaccinated is statically a good idea that I would like to see, especially considering the many places that are now mandating them.",

It‚Äôs not a reasonable foundation from which you should try to force literally every person in the world to get the vaccine. I agreed with your prior. I got vaccinated. Since then pretty much all the data that has come out has caused me to update away from the vaccines being safe and effective. I don‚Äôt think the VAERS reports can or should be handwaved away. And even if the adverse reactions aren‚Äôt as bad as I think, the complete lack of evidence that the vaccines reduce transmission on a population level would be enough to make me think mass vaccination is not a good idea.\n\nI‚Äôm not wedded to these beliefs. There is some evidence that vaccination is helpful, such as reduced rates of death from covid in the vaccinated. But the results on all cause mortality, which is what we really care about, are much more mixed. And more importantly, I haven‚Äôt seen anyone on the pro-vaccine side engage in good faith with what seem to me like pretty important criticisms of the vaccines. That‚Äôs why I would so much like to see a post on this by Scott, because I know that whatever his conclusion, it would be an honest effort to synthesize all the evidence, something I can‚Äôt find literally anywhere else.",

However, for many people this is due to regulations and has nothing to do with vaccine efficacy/safety.\n\nThere are also a large set of people who are unreasonably terrified of COVID-19 (e.g., people who think their children are in danger) and get vaccinated (or get their kids vaccinated) to overcome that unreasonable fear.  Another solution to this specific problem would be to more appropriately inform the population about the level of threat COVID-19 poses to the general population, rather than just telling them to get vaccinated and all their problems go away.\n\nThat all being said, I support voluntary vaccines for all.  It is easier to give people a placebo and tell them it is a cure than to convince them that they didn't have a problem in the first place.  üòä  (note: I'm not suggesting COVID-19 isn't real here, only using the extreme analogy to illustrate the level of fear relative to the level of threat being disproportionate to each other.",

What's the case for getting your kids a flu shot not a covid shot?\n\nBesides, covid is both not particularly dangerous to kids and the number ten cause of child mortality, because nothing that we allow in our society is particularly dangerous to kids. This lets me remove (or at least dramatically mitigate) one risk from my kids lives. A remote risk, to be sure, but nonetheless one I'm glad to take off the board. I'd be happier to take the leaders off the board, but I can't get rid of cars or guns or cancer. Some of the other leaders I've worked pretty hard on. Drowning by making sure they can swim, and drugs and suicide by trying to raise them well and making as sure as I can that lines of communication are open between us and them. We do what we can do. This is something we can do, and it's a clear win in terms of their welfare. \n\nI think any conscientious parent would get their kids vaccinated for their own sakes, quite aside from societal benefits. I'm not actually clear on the case against.",

The risk is still not high, but as you point out, it doesn‚Äôt need to be to exceed the risk from covid. Because we‚Äôre talking about such a small signal, the government would need to do very careful monitoring to detect it, monitoring that they‚Äôre not doing.  The (highly imperfect) data we have suggests the covid vaccine is much more dangerous than the flu shot (and contrary to what you said, the flu is known to be much more dangerous to children than covid). Instead of trying to gather better data on the matter, health authorities have just said ‚ÄúWell, the data we have is imperfect, so we‚Äôll just ignore it and keep saying it‚Äôs probably safe.‚Äù",

As polio became much rarer the goal was to establish \"firewalls\" between vulnerable populations so that the virus could be contained (and eventually eradicated).\n\nIt really is very similar to the current arguments for COVID vaccination.  And why would it not be?  It's not like public health people are just making everything up for the first time, they've thought similarly about these things for decades and are just doing what they've always done.\n\nWhat's different this time is (1) it's happening on a much wider and faster time scale than ever before -- way, way more people are affected, and very promptly, this isn't happening over 5-10 years so we have time to get used to various realities, and (2) we have about 2-3 generations that have grown to adulthood without essentially no experience of serious pandemic disease.  They're far too young to remember polio, and generally too young to remember AIDS.\n\nSo as I said elsewhere the Overton window on the balance of individual rights versus public health has shifted while nobody was looking, and measures that would've been uncontroversial in the 1950s[1] are subject to violent debate now.   Mind you, I'm not saying the debate shouldn't be happening.  In fact, in some sense, it's a remarkable testament to our near-complete victory over infectious disease that we can *afford* to have this debate.\n----------------------\n[1] When the polio vaccines first came out, it was well known that due to limitations in quality control, it would without doubt *give* polio to some children.  But the numbers were run, and it was estimated more kids would  be saved from polio than given polio, so campaigns went ahead, money was set aside for the inevitable victims,  *and people accepted this*.  Imagine if  you will the same thing happening with COVID -- imagine Pfizer saying well, this vaccine has a 98% chance of saving your life but also a 2% chance of giving you a fatal disease (or paralyzing you for life).  Can you imagine modern American just sort of accepting that, because the odds were decent?  I can't.  That's how we have changed, and that, I think, is a major part of why public health people -- who have NOT changed -- have been caught flat-footed and fumbled.",

The existence of other benefits to other people does not erase this fact.  It does not matter why you think a broad recommendation is or should be made, it matters if the factual claim that there is ONLY SPECULATIVE BENEFIT TO OTHERS is true.  And it is clearly and objectively false.  There is specific, proven benefit to the individual receiving the polio vaccine.\n\nThe difference in attitude is obvious.  Polio is a serious disease, covid is not.  And the polio vaccine is not mandated, it is recommended.

What are the odds that you, personally, could be exposed to polio[1], that you would otherwise contract a serious case of it[2] and that therefore you would benefit from the vaccine? \n\nNow compare to the odds that you personally could be exposed to COVID and that you would otherwise contract a serious case of it, and therefore benefit from a vaccine?  (Add in if you like a factor for how likely it is the vaccine works at all, so long as you don't assign a probability of zero, which would  be delusional.)  If you believe the first number is anything more than maybe 10,000 times lower than the second, I would guess you are in very unusual circumstances or are misinformed.\n\n2. Not sure what to say about speculative benefit to others, but this seems to fly in the face of centuries of experience with infectious disease and vaccines.  I'm willing to entertain the hypothesis, but I would need quite a raft of factual observation to find it even worth the time to consider.\n\n3. Polio vaccine is \"mandated\" in much the same sense COVID is: you need to get it in order to participate in certain aspects of public life, maybe (e.g. to go to a public school in the case of polio, or enter the country) -- or it is required by some private organization (e.g. an employer, private college) as a condition of your participation.\n\nMy vague impression is you think the circumstances are very very different largely because the first happened before you were born and you're just used to it, it's not new, and the second is going on now.  But it could be you would also have been violently and passionately opposed to polio vaccine campaigns and requirements (for travel and school) if you'd been around in the 1950s.  Polio is almost always harmless, the vaccine is not always effective (indeed sometimes *gives*  you polio, for first-gen vaccines), it's an infringement on civil liberties to do anything more than just suggest it, et cetera.  Familiar stuff.\n\nWhich is fine, you're entitled as anyone else in a democracy to your opinion on social issues, and entitled to make your case why it should be this way instead of that.  By and by it will be put to  a vote, and you will be expected to abide by the decision of the majority, just as I will be, because that's what it means to live in republic.\n------------------------\n[1] The last native US case of polio was in 1979, and the last case onshore at all was 1993.  As I said elsewhere, the only cases in the world lately have been in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n[2] In general 95% of polio cases resolve without any symptoms at all,  about 5% have mild symptoms, and less than 1% have severe outcomes, e.g. paralysis or death.

While that might not be fully coerced, it isn't really voluntary either, but I think it's OK.  Either way, it cannot be said to be done for the benefit of the patient--it is an act of altruism on the part of the donor, and only the recipient benefits.  Doctors willingly participate in these procedures.\n\nNo, I would not approve of coerced organ donation by still sentient people.\n\n\"Whether there is a moral obligation to do X and whether the state has the right or duty to enforce that obligation are entirely different questions.

So, no, I am not missing a premise.\n\nHigh quality evidence of almost anything about this pandemic is hard to come by.

The rate is supposedly around 4.8 cases per 1 million, but the problem is that COVID itself causes myocarditis, and at a much higher rate than that. Thus it is very difficult to actually demonstrate that the myocarditis was even caused by the vaccine and not a COVID infection; the only argument is that the two events were linked temporally, but you'd expect some people to be infected by COVID close to when they got vaccinated by chance.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7035e5.htm\n\nAccording to that, people infected with COVID-19 had a 0.146% rate of myocarditis, compared to 0.009% for the general population.\n\nThat would suggest that COVID increases the risk of myocarditis by close to 15x.\n\nWorse, the study that claimed the incidence of myocarditis:\n\nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2782900\n\nDidn't actually find any deaths from it, and the rate was comparing segments of time that were pre-COVID entirely to the period when the vaccines were administered, which is problematic because we know that the rate of this condition was NOT the same across these time periods.\n\nAnd yeah, long-term symptoms are a form of disability. Someone who suffers from chronic fatigue, or who has asthma, is suffering from disability. Even loss of smell is a form of disability.\n\nI know someone who has developed asthma and chronic fatigue as a result of COVID; they were not all that sick, but they ended up with lung damage, among other things.\n\nI know that you are in denial about this because you don't want to admit that you are wrong, which is why you are being so hyperaggressive about this stuff.",

The CDC's own Covid burden estimates directly refute your first two points.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html\n\n1) The CDC's estimate for how many kids have actually died of Covid is 645, and ranges as low as 501. 605 deaths is within their 95% CI.\n\n2) The CDC estimates that over 35% of kids have had Covid, and their range goes as high as 44%. But the US is terrible at actually tracking infections. The UK is much better at tracking things, and estimates that nearly 80% of children have had Covid. Splitting the difference gives an estimate of over 50% and less than 60%. Either way, it's blatantly false, by the CDC's own data, to say that less than 20% of children have had it.\n\n3) A recent large French study found the only symptom meaningfully associated with confirmed Covid infection is loss of smell, and the vast majority of people eventually recover it. \n\nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2785832",

The fact that you made a flat-out false claim about what Fauci said shows this - and your response was to try and weasel out of it without admitting that you were wrong.\n\nAnd using UK numbers in the US is questionable.

We are all vaccinated.\n\nSadly people don't want to admit that they're part of the problem so enter into denialism.\n\nThe rate of people having fatal reactions to the vaccine is well under 1 in 1,000,000, which is already more than an order of magnitude lower than the child death rate. The disability rate due to COVID appears to be on the order of a few percentage points, whereas the disability rate due to COVID vaccination appears to be on the order of 1 in 1,000,000.\n\nAnd this is ignoring the fact that vaccinating children has the additional benefit of protecting those who take care of the children; having a caretaker get seriously ill or die is bad for a child, and the idea that preventing that has no beneficial effect on a child is nonsensical.",

Did you notice, for instance, that besides the headline nothing in the text shows that the girl died from Coronavirus? \n\nThey tell you she had a headache and a fever. These are symptoms from most of the non-chronic diseases that exist. She didn't have specific COVID symptoms. \n\nThey tell you that a COVID test was done but never what the result was.\n\nThey say she had a clear chest X-ray and then she died the next day. That's not how people die from COVID.\n\nThey make your mind do a lot of the work here. If you are very scared of COVID then of course everything here reads like she died from it. \n\nIf you actually look at the article, though, it's hard to come to that conclusion. Her parents were vaxxed. Her siblings were vaxxed. Presumably the teachers were vaxxed. The school was masking. There wasn't a single other COVID case around here. They even did contract tracing! That's just not how COVID works. Maybe she died from it but if so they should've mentioned that this case is like a unicorn.\n\nAlso, the pediatric death figure they give. Is that COVID or total? Why be so ambiguous? Why not give a comparison to the average?\n\nMy bet would be that all the errors and omissions in this piece go exactly one way which is to increase your fear. And then they tell you about the stupid school board people that you are now free to hate because they were saying Corona was over while this poor girl lay dying.\n\nNever trust people that appeal to your worst self.",

COVID kills people outside of hospitals quite rapidly. O2 levels crash and they just stop breathing.

Now it get's you called a conspiracy theorist. \n\nI know what the article implies. That's my whole point. It implies a lot but shows nothing. It's written in way to let you fill the gaps with a side of propaganda against your political enemies. Why is it now normal for reporting to be like this? Why won't they just state what the facts are?\n\nI didn't do any research about this girl because it's actually besides the point. I don't contest that healthy young children die from COVID, I just think it's so extremely rare that it's not worth worrying about. \n\nNow that I did research it I found that she is massively obese and it honestly causes me white hot rage because in the article her parents said that she was in \"perfect health\". You (Americans especially but Brits and Germans also) have to finally understand that obesity is not healthy. Obesity is dangerous. Far more dangerous than COVID. If we had done national weight loss programs instead of contact tracing and lockdowns we could've massively reduced mortality for most health related causes in the West AND raised quality of life at the same time. Less money for Amazon and Pfizer though I guess.\n\nThe second thing I notice is that her story went global. I wonder what the effect of such out of all proportion media exposure is on public opinion regarding COVID mitigation measures?\n\n> Happens all the time, actually\n\nShow me single other case were someone died from suffocation within 24h of a chest x-ray that specifically a ruled out COVID pneumonia and I'll concede your point and your very reasonable and very mature questioning of my intelligence.\n\n> The number of sudden heart attacks has gone way up under COVID-19, and it is believed to be another potential complication of the disease.\n\nIt might also be a complication of lockdowns considering that people just didn't dare to go to the hospitals / call ambulances for a while. What stats are you using btw?\n\nSo, I noticed that people that are very worried about COVID have a high capacity to construct ad-hoc stories about Coronavirus. I wonder, do you have good one about how Teresa got COVID from being \"the nurse\" when contact tracing found no one else that tested positive for Coronavirus?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI",

If you want to justify forcing a dangerous vaccine onto children, knowing it will kill some number of them, in order to slightly prolong the life already dying elderly people, then you need to quantify the value of those lives.  Unvaccinated healthy children have a zero risk.  None have died.  Zero.  Morbid obesity is a co-morbidity.  Morbidly obese children are not healthy.  Those teachers and parents are welcome to vaccinate themselves if they are worried.  You do not force innocent children to take dangerous vaccines because you are worried about yourself, YOU take the dangerous vaccine.  It is highly effective at preventing death, remember?  So why do you keep dishonestly acting like everyone else needs to get vaccinated as if your vaccine won't work to protect you?  If you taking the vaccine doesn't protect you, then why would anyone else get it to protect you?  That is absurd.",

For the vast majority of people, and for society at large, there's no question that the vaccines are net life and QoL preserving, even if we accepted the marginal claim about side effects. This is of course hypothetical because there doesn't seem to be either good mechanisms or solid evidence behind any side effects claims. ",

They get studied because a doctor gives them to patients, the patients feel better, and the doctor notices. Without blinding, randomization, and large sample sizes we can't tell if \"some doctors/patients say they have a good/bad feeling about this\" is signal or pure noise. \n\nAt the very least, you ought to concede that it's plausible that the change in reporting could happen without changes in the rate of actual negative vaccine reactions.

The clinical trials were too small and short to effectively monitor safety concerns. VAERS is the solution mandated by law for population-level vaccine monitoring. It would be great if we had a better method, but when the best method you have shows a clear safety signal you can't just say \"It's probably confounded,\" and then ignore it. It should at least be used as a starting point to do large population studies of all cause mortality, and to put a pause on mandatory vaccination efforts until you can prove that the VAERS signal is not real. If you never collect any data, you can just say forever \"Well, we don't know either way,\" which is apparently enough to force everyone to get vaccinated.",

What other databases do we maintain of people self reporting what treatment they think their medical condition might be linked to? If I put up a database of people who thought their medical conditions stemmed from 5g towers nearby, would that be cause for banning further 5g installation nearby? No, because no functional institution is going to let itself be gish galloped by people asking it to disprove low-quality findings with no scientific validity.\n\nFor the record, I think it's heinous that the FDA took so long to approve the vaccines. We had enough safety data early on to justify their use and we could have saved lives by okaying them quicker. As Scott has argued, the FDA is usually too harsh on these issues.\n\nPart of this debate also reminds me of debating anti-GMO people. They always cling on to the idea that side effects will show up in the long term, we just haven't waited long enough yet. You can't prove a negative, so it becomes an unassailable trapped prior.",

You would think that the real evil would be driving policy decisions that line your pockets with cash.",

I constantly get told by public messaging, and people who've taken the vaccine, that it is the most safety monitored vaccine in history.\n\nIn response to your point \"If you never collect any data, you can just say forever \"Well, we don't know either way,\" which is apparently enough to force everyone to get vaccinated.\" Well I've heard there's plenty of data. But.. I don't hear or see anyone outside of the mainstream organizations (CDC, WHO, some medical insiders with access to the VSAFE/other data collection systems) say that they've looked at the data.\n\nWho has access to non-VAERS data, and what analyses and manpower is going into checking these safety signals? Why is not yet made public? It is super frustrating and not a selling point to me to be consistently told to trust the \"aliens\" when they won't make transparent their data and safety monitoring systems while also telling me 1) they're understaffed 2) they're the only ones who can make sense of the data",

I think we can both agree that this is *extremely* underreported.\n\nFor Covid-19 vaccines, they have reported 6,685 cases of Body Temperature Increased. I think we can also agree that this is probably underreported. They also reported 2 cases of \"Blood Group O,\" which I have to assume means two reported their blood types as adverse effects of a vaccine. One person also reported \"Death of a pet.\" I'm not sure how either of these could plausibly be related to the vaccine. And sure, those are tiny numbers, basically roundable to 0%. But then there's the 1,770 cases of \"Blood Glucose Normal,\" making up 0.27% of all \"adverse effects\" of the Covid-19 vaccines. Or the 1,220 that are just \"Blood Glucose,\" no further information. I guess 0.19% of AEs are just \"my blood has sugar in it now.\" Did you know that 3 people reported becoming organ donors as a result of getting their Covid-19 vaccines? It's right there in VAERS.\n\nTo be fair, there's some (though notably less from what I can tell) silliness in the smallpox numbers, too. But smallpox has had 70+ years to accrue weird reports. Covid has managed it in right around a year. I would not describe this situation as Covid AEs being \"even more underreported than usual.\"",

Within a certain number of days (14?) of getting a vaccine, any death, for any reason, gets put into VAERS. Over the last year, instead of vaccinating kids (who are vanishingly unlikely to die in a given two-week period), we've been vaccinating very old people. My 91 year grandmother has gotten three shots. It wouldn't have been surprising at all if she'd died in any of the six weeks when that would have been a VAERS report. Plus we're just in general paying more attention. Of course the numbers are way up.\n\nWhat we then do is monitor for statistical weirdness. If those deaths (or other complications) are out of line with expected rates, then you flag it and check it out. That was the Johnson and Johnson pause for the blood clots and that's the myocarditis too. We *are* checking this. We are checking it so carefully that we can detect possible variances that are occuring in 4 per million cases, and we're making adjustments when we find those things. As, of course, we should.",

It says that 7000 people died within a couple of weeks of getting their vaccines. Since we know who's getting the vaccines and what the expected death rate among those populations is, we can check and see if that's out of line, and it isn't. In cases where something is out of line, even a little, we can do things like switch which vaccine is recommended for a certain demographic group, or pull a vaccine altogether. Both of which have been done. \n\nNone of that is handwaving. The vaccines are safe, and the VAERS data shows that. In order to think it shows the opposite, you both have to misunderstand what it's doing, and then refuse to understand when it's explained.\n\nFor a better, more detailed breakdown, search Benjamin North's comment in this thread.",

None of my close elderly family do, though they all got vaccinated. I dug around a bit but couldn't find any information on this, just breakouts for kids vs adults.\n\nFWIW, my model here is that this last year we had 200 million (ish) people get vaccines, most of them adult or elderly, whereas usually with have 10ish million, most of the pediatric. If it turns out that in a normal year we have 50 million people, most of them elderly, get the flu shot, then yeah, that would make this year's VAERS data look different. Partly I'm presuming that because I trust the relevant institutions, and I feel like that trust is validated by things like the J&J pause or the reports of the 1ish (4ish?) in a million myocarditis.",

[Some argue less rare than we think, but it sounds quite speculative to me.  I haven't seen any claims at all that there are zero side effects.] There are some who don't recommend giving the vaccine to young men, particularly teenagers, because the cardiac complications show up primarily in that group and they gain far less from being vaccinated than older individuals.  The case for children getting vaccinated is worse in that regard, because the hospitalization/fatality rate among children is so low than even a nearly non-existent side effect can still be the same or higher than the actual effects of COVID.

This means if you get a vaccine and then die from a gunshot wound to the head 6 days later you **must** report that to VAERS.\n\nThe system, as designed, is intentionally meant to avoid individual physicians trying to determine causality.  Every event \"must\" be reported regardless of how obviously not-vaccine-related it is, and then statisticians presumably will analyze the data in aggregate afterwards and compare it against background expected death rates or population comparable death rates and look for signals of unexpectedly elevated levels of specific events.\n\nAs an example of why physicians determining causality is a bad idea, one can imagine vaccines causing mental instability that leads to suicide.  Individual physicians would almost certainly assert that \"the vaccine didn't cause suicide, so I shouldn't report it\", but when looking at population level statistics one might notice a sharp rise in suicides among vaccine recipients and that would signal that we (society) should investigate the issue further to determine if there is a causal link or not.",

However, this leaves me confused how such a person could look at the totality of evidence related to the vaccines and walk away with what sounds like near total conviction that the vaccines are \"safe and effective\".  When I look at the totality of evidence I walk away about as confused and uncertain as I think I could possibly be on the matter, and this is after a lot of digging and with some understanding of the biology behind vaccines (including delivery methods).",

                            "body": "I think my personal confidence in the safety and efficacy of the vaccines comes from living in the UK, where we have very good data on all cause mortality and morbidity on a population level. We have given 50m first doses, 46m second doses and 13m booster shots. \n\nWe know from data released weekly that Yellow Card (our version of VAERS) reporting is between 3-6 reports per 1000 cases, and that most of these are mild symptoms like a temperature or sore arm following a dose. These would be expected at a rate of 1 in 10 anyway given the vaccine trial data.\n\nAnaphylaxis in very, very rare situations following the vaccine itself was quickly identified as a problem from this data. It's enormously rare (256 cases/109m doses) but precautions were quickly taken to ensure that any severe issues were mitigated ‚Äì this by introducing a waiting period. \n\nBells Palsy was identified as a possible side-effect, but it's not actually occurring within the population at a higher rate than would be expected normally.\n\nThe big one was clotting with the Astrazeneca vaccine, which occurred at a rate of about 1.9 cases per million doses. The population was of course at more risk of clotting by catching coronavirus itself which everyone would have done without a vaccine. This was mitigated by only giving at risk groups other brands of vaccine. Still incredibly rare, but did lead to a small number of deaths. \n\nAbout 1,000 cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported to the MHRA, causing 5 deaths. For some reason Moderna has 7x as much risk of this as Pfizer and Moderna.\n\nBasically it comes down to the fact that you have about a 26 in a million chance of dying in a car crash in any given year in the UK. The risk of dying as a result of taking the vaccine are in the region of 1 in a million. So a 26th of the chance of driving in a car, which people do all the time without thinking twice about it.\n\nI think most people would describe a Honda Accord as safe and effective at getting you from A to B, if a little uninspiring. Pretty much any Covid vaccine is 25x safer, especially given the death rates pre-vaccine from catching a disease that essentially everyone would have got.\n\n20-49 yo's had a death rate of 1 in 300, (remember, vs 1 in a million for vaccine complications), 1 in 72 people aged 50-59 died, 1 in 27 aged 60-69, 1 in 12 for 70-79, and 1 in 7 over 80s.\n\nVaccines *are* \"safe and effective\", as long as you give them the right context, which is the emergence of a pandemic which would have a much, much, much higher chance of killing me.\n\n",

                    "body": "Honestly, I feel like a lot of the VAERS spike comes down to two things. 1) A lot more people are being vaccinated for this than for other things, and 2) People are actually being told about VAERS and to report any adverse effects.\n\nAddressing the second point first, my second Pfizer shot hit me about as hard as the worst night of my smallpox vaccine. For the Covid vaccine, I had a handy-dandy piece of paper giving me a website I could have reported the fever and chills etc.; for my smallpox vaccine, I didn't even know VAERS existed. I was certainly never told about it when getting yearly flu shots. I would be willing to bet hundreds of dollars that at least part of the increase is being driven by increased awareness of VAERS.\n\nAs for the increased number of vaccines, let's again compare smallpox and Covid. VAERS reports 36 cases of \"Body Temperature Increased\" for smallpox adverse reactions. Since 1990 when they started collecting data. I can give you arbitrarily high confidence that more than 36 such cases have occurred in the last 31 years. That's a rate of basically one fever per year, which is unrealistically low. For Covid, they have 6,685 such cases in what, just over a year? NPR says that 195,000,000 Americans have been fully vaccinated, so if we think that VAERS is being remotely accurate we would conclude that something like. .003% of fully vaccinated Americans got a fever? But I'm pretty sure it's higher than that.\n\nSo I'm not saying that people are over-reporting to VAERS. I'm saying that more people are being vaccinated and they are *under-reporting less* than they have for other vaccines. If you combine those two things that I feel are fairly obvious, it goes a long way to explaining the influx of VAERS reports.",

Of course, someone can come up with an underreporting factor that is greater than 1 and still shows the vaccines as safe, and then they can derive a plausible way to get that underreporting factor (using the line of thinking you have above), but that feels very much like p-hacking or adjusting the endpoint of a study or deciding on grouping/analysis methods after you have the results (which as stated numerous times in this article is bad).\n\nIf you use the \"official\"/previously agreed on methodology for calculating the URF, then you get a strong signal for \"COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous\".  This doesn't mean they *are* dangerous, but it does mean the alarm bell is going off loudly in our signaling system and we are saying \"eh, we can't really trust the signaling system so let's just pretend like the alarm isn't going off and say that vaccines are safe\".",

CDC gives a rate of 11.5 motor vehicle traffic deaths per 100k capita, a rate of 0.0115%, which would put your numbers off by two orders of magnitude.\n\nVAERS reports 6,775 deaths in temporal proximity to Covid-19 vaccination. The CDC gives 195,612,365 as the number of fully vaccinated people. That would be a rate of 0.35%, which does look significantly worse than the traffic rates. However, that makes two assumptions. First, that deaths aren't being underreported. Second, that each of those deaths being reported is actually due to the vaccine. Given that one of the adverse effects reported was \"my pet died,\" I'm pretty sure the latter assumption is not true. I also doubt that the first assumption is true.\n\nThe main question then, is which effect is bigger.

I forgot to multiply by 100 when converting from odds ratio (0.0001) to percentage.  I'll need to rethink my comparison target... and the frequency at which I travel on/near roads!\n\nI think we definitely should not assume that the reported deaths are causally linked to the vaccine (I agree with you strongly on this)!  We should also not assume that the under-reporting rate for VAERS is low because we can trivially calculate the under-reporting rate of death in the case the vaccine was a placebo, which comes out to around 37x if you believe a death within 30 days of vaccine is temporally correlated enough to be worthy of report (half that if you think 15 days is a more reasonable temporal correlation).  Note: some pro-vax people online claim 100x underreporting factor flor for death, some anti-vax people online claim 41x underreporting factor.  I believe I'm being quite generous with 37x, and my calculations are incredibly naive and assume spherical cows and even distribution of all things).\n\nSo what we know is that the VAERS data is greatly under-reported, even for deaths.  We also know that VAERS reports should be *mostly* non-causal for anything but an injection of something outright lethal.  What we don't know is how much under-reporting *actually* happens (we can only establish a floor value, which is really big).\n\nGiven that, I believe that we cannot make the claim that we know with confidence that the vaccine is safe, merely because we do not have any *good* data to back that claim up.  We only have anecdotes (which conflict between people) and models (which requires many assumptions and those assumptions are not widely agreed upon).\n\nPersonally, given that I have a general understanding of how vaccines work (including mRNA and DNA delivered vaccines), I am relatively confident that the vaccines probably won't kill me.  However, I am not nearly confident enough to recommend it to others based on that alone and I'm *definitely* not confident enough to force it onto others or require others do it in order to participate in society.",

                                                                                    "body": ">we can trivially calculate the under-reporting rate of death in the case the vaccine was a placebo, which comes out to around 37x if you believe a death within 30 days of vaccine is temporally correlated enough to be worthy of report (half that if you think 15 days is a more reasonable temporal correlation).\n\nI don't follow. The CDC reports 2,854,838 deaths across 2019, or just shy of 870 deaths per 100k capita. There have been 228,175k people fully vaccinated. If the deaths were evenly distributed between vaccinated and unvaccinated, you would expect something like 1,985,122 vaccinated people to have died this year (also assumes that mortality rates have held since 2019, which they haven't). And then you would expect about 163k of those to occur within 30 days of vaccination assuming that all days have equal death rates (they don't). Dividing that by the 6,775 deaths actually reported gives us a number around 24. I'm not sure whether that counts as an underreporting factor of 23 or 24, but I'm not seeing how it could be as high as 37. And that was assuming that the vaccine has been being administered for 365 full days despite not having been given the EUA until December.\n\nFurthermore, I'm not sure that 30 (or even 15) days is an appropriate cutoff for temporal relation. Unfortunately, I can't find any information on what time limits are put on mandatory reporting. To clarify, take something like the HPV vaccines. Any instance of anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock within 7 days of vaccination is required to be reported to VAERS, and any acute complication or sequelae (including death) of the above events is required with no upper bound on time. So if you go into anaphylactic shock on day 7, spend months in a coma and eventually die or something, all of that has to be reported to VAERS. But if it happened on day 8, it would not be required by law. I have yet to find an upper bound on any event reporting for the Covid-19 vaccines. Afaict, there's not one. Which suggests to me that people are reporting anything that's even plausibly linked to the vaccine as an AE regardless of how long after vaccination it occurred. Now, I'm not saying there should be an upper limit per se, only that we should be applying the same standards as we do to other vaccines. Anaphylaxis, syncope, myocarditis, and pericarditis genuinely linked to the vaccine will typically present within 7 days (high confidence for the first two, medium for the last two). Any other condition that arises as a result of those should have no upper limit. Any other conditions found to be linked to the vaccines should also have time boundaries (current record seems to be Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome resulting from the Seasonal Influenza vaccine, at 3-42 days).",

You know, like I very clearly said.  And you not liking someone's behaviour does not define idiot.  An idiot is someone with a very low IQ.

Pretending the average IQ of people with PhDs is not higher than the average IQ of people with \"some college\" is just moronic.  Your cope is pretty ironic though, as you cling to your delusion and invent silly excuses for data you dislike, while pretending that's what smarter, better educated people than yourself are doing.

            "body": "\"Putting aside the question of accuracy and grading only on presentation and scale, this is the most impressive act of science communication I have ever seen.\" -- surely something that can make you confident that you have learned something true when in fact you have learned something false is *bad* science communication even if the information is accurate, right? One takeaway from this post seems to be that this kind of chart isn't a good way to communicate science even when the underlying claim is true, because it provides a false sense of confidence and promotes a common misunderstanding of how progress in science actually works (\"just take all the effect sizes from the papers and put them together without stopping to understand all the underlying science / which papers you can trust / what sorts of evidence experts are used to seeing for claims that turned out to be false /etc.) \n\n\"Can something have a p-value less than 0.001 and still be a fluke?\"\n\nYes of course!! P-values only measure the probability of flukes under the null hypothesis assuming everything went exactly according to plan. But there are lots of boring flukes (a table got mixed up somewhere in the data entry process, the randomization got screwed up in a way the balance tests missed, a doctor felt bad that these patients were on a deworming drug for a virus and slipped them antivirals, etc.) that are unlikely but not \"literally one in a thousand\" unlikely.\n\n\n\n\n",

I could be persuaded by such a comparison, if done right.\n\nThe bar is fairly high, though, because the usual proxies for transmissability, e.g. viral load in the nasal passages, have definitely been studied in vaxed/non-vaxed, and they are definitely lower.  So it would be a surprising result -- how can lower viral load nevertheless *not* lead to lower transmissability?\n\nIt's possible there is an answer to this, e.g. behavioral changes in the vaccinated versus unvaccinated compensate for the reduction in viral load.  Although that one in particular says boo about the efficacy of the vaccines per se, it just says that there are human and sociological factors that may overwhelm the biochemical factors.",

The most relevant sentences from the abstract should start you off in the right direction:\n\n\"By analyzing viral loads of over 16,000 infections during the current, Delta-variant-dominated pandemic wave in Israel, we found that BTIs in recently fully vaccinated individuals have lower viral loads than infections in unvaccinated individuals. However, this effect starts to decline 2 months after vaccination and ultimately vanishes 6 months or longer after vaccination. Notably, we found that the effect of BNT162b2 on reducing BTI viral loads is restored after a booster dose.\"\n\nNone of that is the least bit surprising, although the specific numbers and timelines are probably a bit disappointing for public policy.   In other places you will find measurements that show that vaccinated people who *actually contract symptomatic COVID* (so-called \"breakthrouth\" = the vaccine didn't work so well for this individual cases) have viral loads that don't differ materially from unvaccinated people with symptomatic COVID which, again, is hardly surprising although again disappointing.  One would have hoped the lessened severity of the disease in the vaccinated meant lower infectiousness, too, but alas doesn't look that way.",

This is worse than regular randomization, because there could be differences between these health centers (eg one might have better doctors who otherwise give better treatment, one might be in the poor part of town and have sicker patients, etc).\"\nThe same argument could be made against individual based randomisation, eg \"there could be differences between these individuals (eg one might have chronic diabetes and do poorly, one might be in excellent health and do well)\".\n \nCluster randomisation and individual randomisation are basically the same except that the denominator in a cluster randomised trial is not the number of individuals but the number of clusters (the unit of randomisation).\nThere are situations where doing cluster randomisation *is* the best thing to do, for example when you think there could be interactions between individuals in the clusters (the example I have in mind in mass drug administration for an infectious disease, give it to a whole village - the cluster - and you can wipe it out, whereas if you give it to individuals at random they can then re-infect each other).",

Also, it's assembled artificially instead of by some other organism.  To be sure, those are not necessarily trivial differences, but the *mechanism* -- the route by which it gets into the cell, the route by which it provokes in immune response -- is very similar to what natural viruses do.

If the IVM only lowers severity by avoiding hyper worm growth, it should have basically no effect on preventing getting a COVID case. Triangulating the evidence would probably strengthen your case, would you try that out or read an analysis of that? OTOH it would be puzzling otherwise. The prophylaxis results are at the bottom of this table https://ivmmeta.com/#fig_fp .\n\nPerhaps reconsider including Mayer et al. Or rather, given the potential for that choice to swing your analysis, you might take more time to consider your logic on excluding it. Yes it is not an RCT. But the point of RCT is to even out factors among both groups to not favor either the control or the threatment. It's highly improbable for obese, diabetic, many other co-morbidities  IVM group to outperform, given even one of those conditions increases hospitalization / mortality risk around 1.5 to 2x (from my fallible memory).  P(results | ivermectin is working in high parasite places AND Argentina is a low parasite place) should be quite low yet the results are more improbable than the unadjusted p value p<.03 stated in the post. Is an adjusted analysis where they regress to mostly remove those differences, more informative for that probability i.e. \"risk of death, 55.1% lower, RR 0.45, p < 0.001, treatment 3,266, control 17,966, adjusted per study, odds ratio converted to relative risk, multiple logistic regression, Figure 3.\"  ?https://c19ivermectin.com/mayer.html\n",

The analysis linked in Avi Bitterman's tweet, which looks at the effect of ivermectin in regions (of high, medium and low prevalence of Strongyloides) doesn't actually find a significant difference in risk between those subgroups (p=0.27). That is, there isn't evidence that there's an interaction; that it's effective in places with high prevalence but not effective in places with low prevalence. The effect in the high prevalence regions individually is also barely significant (p=0.02). This is an example of the idea which Andrew Gelman popularised, that 'the difference between ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù and ‚Äúnot significant‚Äù is not itself statistically significant'.",

Scott seems to be trying to steelman Ivermectin support as a dry epistemic determination when it's clearly motivated reasoning. Ivermectin enthusiasts want it to be a good treatment because they don't want to take the vaccine. They don't want to take the vaccine because it's a Boo Red Tribe button. It's a Boo Red Tribe button because it got politicized. Also, the aliens in that Red Tribe view aren't immunologists, but the political and cultural elites whom they (somewhat correctly) model as being willing and able to control the narrative of What Immunology Says.",

At least not a long lasting one. I'm thinking that the best strategy would have been to get deliberately infected with a recent wuflu strain (delta?) a month or two after vaccination because it looks like vaccination does limit immune system overreaction for a few months.\n\nI also completely do not understand why the vaccine enthusiasts want to vaccinate people who have recovered from the disease. This makes no logical sense to me since if you have had the disease you almost certainly have a decent (likely very very good)  immune system response anyway and the vaccine isn't going to help. If you were infected and for whatever reason you don't have a good immune system response why is a vaccine that works by triggering your immune system going to do any better?",

Now that you lay it out so clearly, I wonder how this hasn't been part of the standard story about Ivermectin since day one? \"It doesn't do much against Covid on its own, but it *is* a good dewormer; getting Covid while having a worm infection can make the Covid more dangerous, so people who get Covid while they may have worms can benefit from taking Ivermectin\". It seems so obvious when you put it like that.\n\nSurely the people who did those studies in areas of the world where worms are endemic, would have been aware that probably a lot of the patients in their study groups had worms, and that therefore Ivermectin being a dewormer probably had something to do with its effectiveness? Wouldn't they check for that?\n\nIn the summary, Scott writes \"Parasitic worms are a confounder in ivermectin studies.\" Wouldn't another valid conclusion be \"Ivermectin *actually does work* to reduce Covid symptoms, in the subset of patients who happen to have a parasitic worm infection? Which may be a nontrivial percentage of patients, depending on which area of the world we're talking about.",

An entire tube of ivermectin intended for horses will have absolutely no negative effect on a person, and that is a very large overdose, which requires a very dumb person to accidentally manage to do.  If someone can't figure out that they weigh less than a horse, they also couldn't follow anything written in the post.  The rate and severity of side effects from ivermectin are less than tylenol.  Don't swallow the laziest and most dishonest media schlock so unquestioningly.  This is the same kind of stupid nonsense vets have been spouting for years to con people into paying $60 for heart worm prevention ivermectin for their dog, when they could get several years worth for $8 from the farm store.  \"You are too stupid to do grade school arithmetic, you couldn't possibly figure out the dose!\".",

Mahmud et al. really does show that Ivermectin is effective in reducing the average number of days required for clinical recovery (in Bangladesh, or really just in Dhaka. Also at the time the study was done). This is the same issue people have with studies on WEIRD populations being used to make broad sweeping claims.\n\nThe prevalence or lack of worms seems like a good explanation for the failure of results to generalize. It's consistent with the data, although as another comment points out, that difference is not statistically significant (p=.27). It's also makes sense, Ivermectin is helpful in areas where the condition Ivermectin treats is more prevalent. As a bayesian, the combination of these gives me a pretty good confidence (85%?) that this is the explanation.\n\nAnd it was obscured by a lot of bad/fraudulent studies as well.",

I don't want to judge it, I'm sure it is meant for the best and sometimes it may even be necessary. But at an other level it doesn't show respect at all, in the opposite it expresses: 'You are too stupid to take decisions and responsibility for your own life.' \nIf you want the people to listen to your arguments you have to show respect to them. With pressure perhaps they give in and get vaccinated, but they don't feel respected and don't trust you anymore. Others get ideological and just want to proof that they are independent and dont let you push them around. Than they hear you say that [...] is bullshit and doesn't help at all. Why should they trust you? Why isn't this just the next of your tricks to get your will after pressure didn't help?\n \nPerhaps it is especially the teachers, cops and nurses that know this, because they work with many different people every day and know how they think and react. And especially unions are used to focus on self determination and questioning power.\n\nI think on the long term it always is much better to respect peoples hesitations and choices, because than they are open to new data and evidence when it shows up and they can change they mind without loosing their face.\n\nImagine yourself being hesitant to something that is affecting your most private place, your body, how would you like 'a small push'? I think this would cause resistance as in most people. \n\nI know this first hand from my brother who worked many years as a paramedic, his girlfriend is a nurse. He literally said to me this summer: \"Perhaps this vaccinations work as well as most other vaccinations, and I really think it does good to many people. But at the moment I don't really see the benefit for me to get vaxinated as I'm a young healthy man working outside as in a small team not meeting many people. But the more all the society, the media and politics pushes everyone to get vaccinated and they act as if this is the only solution. The more they push the more resistance builds up in me, not for medical arguments, just to prove my independence and not to be pushed around.",

Perhaps there's a time for the majority respecting the individual, whether or not he seems to be making sense, and a time for the individual to respect the majority, whether or not it seems to be making sense.\n\nOr to add some additional lyrics, from Kenny Rogers:\n\n\"You've got to know when to hold 'em\nKnow when to fold 'em\nKnow when to walk away\nKnown when to run.\"\n\nI'm not being facetious, either.  I think there is a sad parallel with the Civil War here.  I *agree* with the Southern antebellum views on quite a lot of  things, about the importance of state's rights, for example, and I think they had the better view of the Constitution.  But they hung all this most excellent thought on the most appalling and disgusting aim, a defense of the right of one man to own another -- and so everything worthwhile about that point of view went up in smoke, because it was used to defend an abomination.\n\nSimilarly, I'm horrified that so much of the right has chosen to hang its most excellent arguments on individual rights, the proper limits of government power, et cetera -- on defending the right of individuals to do something which looks  by all reasonable historical precedent to be in practice dumb, or at best neutral, and can plausibly be argued (whether or not it is in fact true) to put the health of millions at some kind of unknown risk.\n\nPhilosophically, there's much to be said about their reasoning, and in fact I agree with almost all of it -- but using it to defend an antivax point of view is the height of practical folly, a ludicrous failure to pick your battles wisely, the kind of thing that can very easily take down the entire point of view with it.  It's an excellent example to my mind of picking the wrong issue to go to the mat over principle on, like choosing to defend free speech in a child pornography case instead of a deplatforming/Twitter assassination case in which some minority view on global warming is suppressed.",

                            "body": "I agree that most people who haven't been vaccinated are willing to get vaccinated, but I still have reservations about the implementation of vaccine mandates in this case.\n\nIn a July 2021 survey by Statistics Canada [1], over 94% of respondents had already been vaccinated or said that they were \"likely\" or \"very likely\" to choose to be vaccinated in the future. Despite this, nationally, only 80% of Canadians have received a dose of COVID-19 vaccine according to Our World In Data (though plenty of regions have rates above 90%). This implies that most people who haven't yet been vaccinated responded in July that they were \"likely\" or \"very likely\" to choose to do so. So I agree with your analysis, at least in Canada, that most people, at least at one point, were willing to get vaccinated but just hadn't, for whatever reason.\n\nI recall seeing articles (which I can find if you want) that said that Toronto Public Health was having success with door-to-door vaccination, though it's not been deployed broadly across Canada to my knowledge (I know specifically that it's not happ\nened at all where I live). This suggests that simply spending the money to knock on doors would get a lot of people vaccinated.\n\nI think there's a general consensus that vaccine mandates will raise vaccination rates (though I couldn't find any direct evidence in a quick search, I think this is probably true, though perhaps less so than people think). But this leads to the uncomfortable conclusion that governments in Canada are, in fact, using vaccine mandates as a cost-saving measure rather than spe\nnd the money on door-to-door vaccination drives. I think this is clearly immoral. First, given that we already do door-to-door drives for the census, it's clearly not cost-prohibitive. A vaccine mandate is an infringement on freedom - I don't think anyone would deny that. I think it's justified if it's necessary to make sure people who want to be safe from COVID can in fact go to place like restaurants without having to worry. But I don't think it's justified if the same effect could be achieved without a mandate. (You could argue that people intended to do both - door-to-door campaigns and vaccine mandates - but in practice that hasn't happened, so it's kind of irrelevant.)\n\nTo approach this a bit differently, I don't think it's acceptable to use vaccine mandates with the goal of increasing vaccination rates; rather, I think the only acceptable goal of a vaccine mandate is to allow things like indoor dining that otherwise wouldn't be safe to take place. I think that many advocates of vaccine mandates see increasing vaccination rates as a primary benefit of them.\n\nThis is really frustrating, because I support vaccine mandates in general. I just hate that we've somehow managed to make what's clearly a good policy into something that's at best morally ambiguous.\n\nI also wonder what it says about the way people view unvaccinated people. I worry that people don't really view them as human, or as deserving of compassion. I think that would be really sad.\n\n[1] https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/210709/dq210709b-eng.htm",

I think it's always important to remember the human when making policy, and acknowledge that humans have feelings, not just incentives. One thing I heard a lot from teachers is that people won't remember what you teach them, but they will remember how you made them feel. I think that's an important idea.\n\n(I know I'm saying a lot of \"potentially\" and \"could\". I could probably find support for my claims but I've done enough research for today already.)",

I was rooting for the vaccines, ideally they really would have \"got us out of the pandemic\".\n\nAbout the vaccines - i have no idea how you can reach the conclusion that they are \"very safe and effective\" - here are a few things that poke holes in that conclusion.\n\n1. High vaccination rates having no correlation with low case rates. Many countries or cities with high vaccination rates are seeing explosions in cases\n2. Several studies that show waning vaccine efficacy over time, both for prevention of disease and reducing symptoms\n3. Excess mortality being higher this year in many countries where vaccines were rolled out compared to last year.\n4. Consistently much higher rates of adverse events recorded in monitoring databases such as VAERS ( And is the case over many different countries ) \n\nNot that this is a black and white picture, I do think that the vaccines seem to reduce mortality for Covid, but the question is how long for and if there's anything else that we could do to help those who catch the disease in addition to vaccination.

Sporting events.  Offices.  Kids are in school.\n\nLast summer none of that was true unless you were a \"deviant\".

But we didn't do that... we merely reduced the average number of people that we came in contact with.  It stands to reason that it *should* reduce spread, but, as the old saw goes, \"In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice...\"  For instance, when everyone was staying at home and only in contact with one or two people a day, who were they in contact with?  Essential workers that were still in contact with 100s of people.  Is that effect enough to undo the theoretical reasons that we should have flattened the curve?  I certainly don't know, and are you 100% sure that it wasn't?\n\nSimilarly, CDC estimates about 40% of people had and recovered from COVID, which is on the order of the ~40% reduction in cases/hospitalizations/positivity rate.  Deaths are dramatically down and I'm willing to chalk that up to vaccines (although I wouldn't blithely disregard selection effects and/or improved treatment over the last year).\n\nAnd I think that was the original point: we're all arguing from theory and whataboutism, and the \"common sense\" answers to all these questions are contradictory.  To reiterate Leaf's point: \"I haven‚Äôt seen anyone try to do a serious analysis of the seeming flaws that have shown up with the vaccines. \"",

You stopped seeing the 20 people at the office but kept going to the store.\n\nHowever in the places of real outbreaks life truly did grind to a halt.  You really did go from regularly brushing shoulders with hundreds of people a day to maybe seeing the cashier at the grocery store.\n\nAnd yes Urban areas were the hardest hit areas of COVID for all these reasons.\n\nI'm with you that the data looks like the vaccines we have aren't 100% bulletproof, especially against different strains.  But stop being delusional with basic facts.\n\nThe US re-opened in the summer of 2020 and had a huge outbreak of infection.  Every time we tried to reopen things went up.  And none of those reopenings looked like today's world.\n\nYour odds of going to the hospital are lower if you've been vaccinated, even lower than if you had a previous infection: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7044e1.htm\n\nThese changes matter. These changes mean I can go about living a normal life without people screaming at me that I'm trying to kill them and their loved ones.  \n\nI guess the alternative is a globally coordinated conspiracy theory.  Outside of that, I can't see how you can look at the data and the context and conclude the vaccines are \"ineffective\" \n\n",

Your position is more likely and optimistic, for sure, and I don't disagree that the differences in deaths is significant.  \n\nBut I think this is all missing the point.  My glib comment provoked in you the exact response that Leaf was complaining about: \"Of course it's all behavior related, what else could it be?  Safe and effective!  Now check out my immunobridging studies in 5-11 year olds and let's get jabbin'!!!\"  (Editorial liberties taken.)\n\nTo someone like me, whose priors include things like \"of course dietary cholesterol leads heart disease\" or \"of course mass screening for prostate cancer will lead to reductions in mortality\" or \"of course vioxx is safe and effective,\" an argument like \"of course we would have had a lot more cases if we didn't shut everything down\" is not terribly persuasive on its face, especially when my CDC-trained immunologist sister-in-law was complaining about how the lockdown policies were throwing pre-established playbooks.  But fine, how much worse would it have been without behavior modification? 2x? 10x? Just calculating that will probably require dubious assumptions, but we can roll with it.  Is that multiplier consistent with purported vaccine efficacy and current vaccination rates and current case rates?  Does it pass the sniff test when comparing Sweden to other countries, or Florida/Texas to other states, or in some cases neighboring counties?\n\nI will furthermore gladly accept the accusation that I'm demanding more evidence for this vaccine versus others, because there are a lot of unprecedented things about this vaccine (development speed, roll out, and delivery mechanism) for a disease with, by the CDC's own numbers, a <1% mortality rate clustered in an age range that doesn't include me.",

One of the reasons I enjoy the comment section of this blog.\n\nYou raise fair points.  I guess, for me, when I don't have sufficient data to understand the micro picture I look at the macro picture.\n\nTo me the macro picture says:  The whole world responded pretty dramatically to this.  I am willing to say that my read of the COVID mortality risks and related matters is more than likely wrong.  Or one of the following must be true: there is a massive conspiracy.  Or the whole world which has literally never agreed on anything together suddenly had group think. \n\nIf I really explore my priors, the universal response from the world does carry a lot of weight.  It's my tiebreaker.  Maybe that says something about my willingness to trust \"authority\".\n\nDo I think there were a lot of heavy hands in this process? Absolutely.  To my earlier comment, for most of America the lockdown was fairly pointless.  It reduced the number of people someone interacted in a week from 20 to 4.  For places like Boston and NYC, dense transit oriented cities, my *guess* is that was likely the right move to some degree.   I mean look at all the outbreaks in meat packing plants and other facilities that stayed open.  \n\nThere is so much we don't know.   I don't judge the vaccine hesitant, especially those in low risk age groups.  I was definitely not the first in line. \n\nThat said, I've taken many substances in my life of uncertain origin and which many fewer people have taken.  \n\nJust like in every other decade, we are going to find out something we're using in industry causes terrible long term effects.  In 2050 there will be \"Do you suffer from Alient Mematic Plague caused by exposure to CFCs used in office building HVAC?\" commercials.\n\nWe live with a levels of risk and uncertainty so far above what anyone realizes.  It is interesting how much COVID has turned this on its head but that's a story for another thread.\n\nA bit rambling here, but I guess here's my closing statement on our little debate here:\n\nLikely less effective in the field than in the lab? Absolutely.\n\nIs it likely that the COVID vaccine will end up similar to the flu vaccine, requiring tweaking & boosting?  80-90% prediction however I think the need from a mortality/severity side is less certain, 50% prediction\n\nAre we finding huge outbreaks from gatherings (like the conference held in Boston in 2020) anymore?  Not that I can tell. 70% prediction.\n\nAre vaccinated people achieving better medical outcomes than unvaccinated people? Yes 95% prediction.\n\nAm I now living a normal life again for the first time in 1.5 years?  Yes, 100% prediction.\n\nAm I going to recommend to anyone who asks me to get the vaccine?  Yes\n\n",

People already distance themselves from individuals who will make them sick.

I'm not willing to die on any of these hills so I'll grant that the vaccines appear to be protective against death.\n\nI think the jury's definitely still out on whether it's effective against infection.  CDC admits it doesn't control the spread, and UKHSA's data has VE against cases at -100% (!) for some age groups.  (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1034383/Vaccine-surveillance-report-week-46.pdf Table 6).  Yes yes, you aren't supposed to estimate VE from this data because it's in the real world not a laboratory etc.  but it still stinks.  \n\nBut let's go with \"perhaps cutting the risk in half, and that can easily be canceled by changes in behavior.\"  So, if we aren't using UKHSA's data for VE estimates, we can use your 50% reduction in cases and the observed case rates to estimate the effects of behavior change based on vaccination status, which pencils out to about 2x cases / (1- 50% efficiency) = ~4x the spread due to behavior.  \n\nThat doesn't jive: the initial estimates of R0 were ~3-5 or so if I recall.  So in this case, the behavior change would be R0 / 4 < 1 (on the low end) and poof, no pandemic.   But that's not what happened...  Similarly, I don't think comparing e.g. Sweden to other Scandinavian countries would support a 4-fold reduction in transmission due to behavior changes.\n\nI would be extremely happy to hear that I am wrong and I'm not starring in \"They Live.\"   But as Leaf mentioned above (and you just illustrated), the response to any data that disagrees with the narrative is met with handwaving and \"vaxx to the maxx!\"",

My tribe is my real actual biological tribe, not democrats or republicans or liberals or conservatives or sportsball_team_x fans.  I genuinely have no allegiance to political or social nonsense, only to my actual tribe.  This is confusing to both liberals and conservative, who can not think beyond the surrogate tribes they have adopted, and so liberals call us \"far right\" and conservatives call us \"socialists\".  I really can say there is no tribal reason for me to be for or against these vaccines.\n\nThere is simply no compelling evidence that would suggest a healthy young person should get vaccinated with an experimental, unsafe vaccine for a virtually risk free disease.  I recommended that my elderly grandmother get vaccinated, because the risk of COVID for her is higher than the likely risk from the vaccines, and although we can not be certain of long term risks, she probably doesn't have much of a long term to be concerned about in the first place.\n\nBut I am not elderly, I have no health problems, I do not consume polyunsaturated fats, and I have adequate vitamin D levels naturally from sun exposure.  My risk of being hospitalized from COVID is nonexistent.  I may well have already had it and not even known, because it is only a serious illness in people who are not healthy.  The average age of COVID deaths is higher than the average lifespan.  I am more likely to struck by lightning on my way to get vaccinated than I am to be killed by COVID.  The bizarre insistence on ignoring this obvious reality and pretending everyone should be afraid of COVID is much more likely to be tribal than the \"get it if you are at risk, don't bother if you are not\" mentality that most of us so-called \"anti-vaxxers\" have.",

Way back in September, under the post \"Too Good To Check: A Play In Three Acts\":\n\nhttps://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/too-good-to-check-a-play-in-three\n\t\n\"Deiseach Sep 6\nI think people are seeing positive results (and that Cochrane meta-study has links to a lot of studies that are \"no result/slight result\" rather than \"wowzers, this is a miracle cure!\") is because (a) many of the studies, as listed above, are done in countries where I'd expect a lot of poor/rural communities with bad/poor health outcomes, including worm and other parasite infestations and (b) everyone is looking for the new silver bullet.\n\nSo you're a peasant farmer in Bangladesh and you picked up a worm infestation. You also picked up a dose of Covid. Treating you with an anti-parasitic drug in combination with other therapies is going to show a better result than leaving your system to fight off both at once.\"\n\nI also dived into some of the Cochrane meta-study on the Ivermectin studies to see where all the countries were located:\n\n\"Deiseach Sep 7\nWell, I could be totally wrong and ivermectin turns out to be an amazing anti-viral on top of everything else. But I'm going to stick to \"it does what it says on the tin and if you're suffering from sarcoptic mange mites, go right ahead, but otherwise cool it unless a doctor prescribes the human version to you\".\n\nPeople are so anxious for \"definite sure-cures!\" that they'll swallow (ha!) any story about \"this showed up in clinical trials as IT REALLY WORKS\". I'm just surprised to see otherwise reasonable people jumping at \"Doctors hate this ONE WEIRD TRICK\" kind of story, but hey, we're all only human!\"\n\nAlso got into some arguing with another commenter, but sure, that's me for ya!\n\n\"\t\nDeiseach Sep 7\n\"One even needs zero studies when looking at the raw figures which came out of India where a ‚Äònatural‚Äô experiment happened with their big covid wave a few months ago. These are extremely positive results and we should be trying whatever we can in a pandemic as long as it is safe. There is even passive evidence from lower covid rates in some parts of Africa, quite possibly matching up well with existing use of ivermectin for its well known and longstanding use against parasites which can cause blindness.\"\n\nIvermectin is well-known and longstanding use *against parasites*, which you mention in your comment, but seem not to have understood. You are saying \"this is a safe and effective drug!\" and yes it is - *when used as intended*.\n\nWhat you are extrapolating from \"it's used to treat parasitic infections in humans\" is \"therefore it should be used for covid\", with a side of \"what can it hurt, it won't kill you\" and unexamined anecdotes about \"and they used it in India and they're getting fabulous results!\"\n\nI'm not so convinced about those fabulous results, I imagine that any benefits may come from the anti-parasitic treatment. If you have two patients, A and B, both in hospital undergoing treatment for Covid, and both have roundworm infestations as well, and A gets treated with Ivermectin which kills off the roundworms but B does not - I am going to guess that A will do better than B. But I don't think you can conclude from that \"Ivermectin cures Covid!\"\n\nAnd the problem with this sunny assumption of \"what harm can it do?\" is that some people are refusing to get vaccinated, which is our best preventative at present, and along with others are all rushing off to buy veterinary products containing ivermectin, which are graduated for animals much larger than humans; believing this will save them; overdosing then because they're taking dosages calibrated for horses and cows; then ending up in the hospital with the side-effects of same.\"\n\nAny credit is purely down to the agricultural ads on the national television and radio broadcaster of my nation and my youth; that so firmly fixed ivermectin in my brain as cattle drench and for sarcoptic mange mites, I had incredulity built up about \"it'll cure Covid\".",

            "body": "I've been thinking a lot about what to replace \"trust the science\" with. We have this compulsion to over-fetishize scientific form (p-values are a weird, barely useful social construct in a world as nebulous and interconnected as ours) precisely to defend against an outside view problem where low-effort conspiracy theories look exactly the same as correct contrarians without doing a lot of work to sift it out. But when you think about fraud from a institutional lens a la Davies's Lying for Money, you can see that \"what matters is where it came from!\" as a position is tailor-made to let people cash in on the form as a free credibility signal. The cranks are great at throwing in stats words now, and have been for a while.\n\nTo think about the way forward, it's worth making the ethnomethological flip (https://metarationality.com/ethnomethodological-flip). That is - how do the people who *are* right actually *do it?*?  I'm a temporarily-embarrassed immunologist too, and I was the one who warned all my friends about COVID-19 in Feb '20. I wasn't reading studies and I wasn't calculating p-values. How did I know anyway? Well, because I followed Zeynep Tufekci and a lot of Hong Kongers and had an easy time putting the pieces together. But conspiracy theorists are also great at writing little stories to explain anecdotal evidence. You can say in principle that relying on anecdote here doesn't work because there are also anecdotes about FEMA death camps. But do the flip; I DID believe the good anecdotes, and I didn't believe the bad anecdotes, so it's clearly possible somehow and that somehow doesn't involve math or probability. \n\nThis has been my research area for a few months and I suspect that a lot of the secret sauce is ontological. Ontologies can't be *right or wrong* but they can be *better or worse*, and we're not really used to talking about them in that way. So I think people end up talking at cross-purposes a lot because some people are Just More Likely To Be Right because they're using a more sensible ontology, but we don't have the language to make that claim. So we can try to assume that \"using a better ontology\" and \"following proscribed scientific norms\" are the same thing - and they probably match above random chance - but there's plenty of cases where it's not true which gives cranks all the ammunition they need.\n\nThe slogan ought to be something like \"trust the most sensible ontology\", but we have scads of really urgent work to do on helping people determine sensible ontologies. And this work historically has been done through mentorship which is why things feel so distinctly odd nowadays.",

This is an article from Cris Moore about how R0 is really unhelpful as a measure for diseases with heavy tails:\n\nhttps://sfi-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/sfi-edu/production/uploads/ckeditor/2020/04/27/t-024-moore.pdf\n\nLet's say we're in the future now. There's a few flareups of a new disease and we're trying to figure out if it will be a pandemic. Someone writes a paper estimating R0 as .8 and says that we don't have to worry. I wake up from my coma and only read their paper. I worry a lot, because R0 is a bad estimator to use in isolation, and equating R0 with risk is an enormous red flag. I didn't do ANY research, I haven't made ANY probabilistic guess, I just said \"It clearly exists (because you had to write a paper about it), and R0 isn't really a measure you can use to call things safe. If it was actually safe, you'd have a real reason to say why. If the best point you can think of is invoking R0, we're boned.\"\n\nThis made up person did a lot of research work, and I didn't do a god damn thing, and I haven't said anything about the methods or data analysis they employed. But I have a smarter **way of representing the relevant factors**. So I think this is a pretty sizeable hint that representations are critically important, and probably a big part of how we actually go about the work of sifting the wheat from the chaff enough to keep the lights on.\n",

Because she kept being right when other people were wrong. She's a journalist with no special expertise, and there's nothing that would've stopped her from turning out like Alex Berenson, the infamous \"pandemics wrongest man.\" But her predictions kept coming true and her policy reccomendations made sense, neither of which is true for Berenson. I feel like we keep wanting a form or structure to validate epistemic authority for us, but ultimately the only authority is whether what someone says comforts with the data.\n\n\nI feel crazy sometimes as someone who has realized that the WHO, CDC, FDA, etc. embarrassed themselves by getting major issues wrong but not thinking that Fauci is the devil or something. These orgs are run by basically competent bureaucrats and I trust them on a lot of banal issues. Maybe I'm just reinventing Bayesianism here, but we can trust orgs like this as far as they've been accurate without making it a binary switch.\n\nI'd like to hear more of your point about ontology, but I'm not quite sure how you're using it. If you're using it in a standard way to refer to platonic forms, nomination, metaphysics or naturalism, etc., I'm skeptical.

The point I want to make is just that \"she kept being right\" is a phrase that, in a rationalist community, can sometimes imply a lot of excess baggage: are we saying that Zeynep gave probabilistic predictions that were above random chance? Did Zeynep predict the outcomes of studies? No, she dealt with anecdote. What does it mean for an anecdote to be right, when you can always do any degree of special pleading to explain any outcome?\n\nCorrectness here was coarse-graining in the correct way. She \"kept being right\" because she made the sort of claims where a given observation we could all make would count as right with respect to those claims. All her prediction boiled down to was \"The reasons why novel infectious diseases often don't take off don't apply here; this rhymes with SARS enough PLUS differs on the key metric of asymptomatic infectivity that it will be bad.\" If Zeynep had been forced to give a number of exactly how bad it would get, it would have been a total potshot and likely would have been objectively wrong. If Zeynep had been forced to write her thoughts as a study, or as a rebut to a study, they would have been way too slow. \n\nSo a major part of being right here is making the *kind of claim that can be right*. That's what I mean by factoring in ontology. Nothing about naturalism or platonic forms. More that focusing overmuch on studies and evidence can blind us to how effective people actually do decision making in highly uncertain and quickly changing environments, which has a lot to do with reducing things to the right factors instead of finding the right coefficients for the factors you have. The people who were thinking in terms of \"takeoff or no? What factors stop most takeoffs and are they relevant here?\" were correct; the people who were trying to predict the R0 of COVID-19 in February '20 were wrong, **regardless of what R0 they ended up calculating**, because they were thinking about it **in the wrong way**. Does that make sense?",

Why do you not apply any skepticism to the mainstream narrative?  Take Dr. Malone for another example.  Read his wikipedia page.  Google his name.  And consider, he is objectively a real doctor, an actual virologist, and the man who discovered that it was possible to transfer mRNA protected by a liposome into cultured cells to signal the information needed for the production of proteins.  These are not subjective claims, and they should not be (and were not) controversial.  This is a man who, until the politicization of COVID was a well respected scientist and in no way controversial at all.   Now all you can find about him is that he is a fraud who claims to have discovered the basis for mrna technology, but that he is really an evil far right nazi terrorist conspiracy klansman who is killing millions of babies with his evil facebook COVID memes!  His wikipedia article can't even make enough of a pretense of objectivity to call him \"Dr. Malone\".  How can someone look at this level of insane 1984 manipulation of public opinion, for someone who has very objectively done absolutely nothing wrong, and think \"there's definitely nothing suspicious here, I have no reason to doubt any aspect of the media/government complex's ever shifting narrative at all!\".

Infected cattle are prone to contracting severe bronchial pneumonia which if left untreated can lead to death.\"\n\nAnd partly because I do not see how something that is mainly a wormer cattle drench is going to be a great anti-viral.  Maybe it is!  In vitro - which is a hell of a lot different than in vivo.\n\nMy position has always been that the good results came from trials in places where, as Scott points out, people are prone to worm and parasite infestations.  My totally untutored guess was that the ivermectin treated parasites, which took strain off the immune system, which gave back capacity to fight Covid, and so yes treated patients did better than untreated.\n\nBut if you really want to inject or swallow or pour on ivermectin on yourself, I still think your best option is to be a cow in a field.",

Are you afraid of taking erythromycin?  Because if you go by the \"cover our ass\" disclaimer that comes with it when prescribed for chickens, you can never eat an egg from a chicken who was given erythromycin ever again.  Does it make sense that I can take erythromycin just fine, but the unlikely and untested possibility that a vastly smaller quantity of erythromycin could be in an egg makes the egg unsafe?  It is just a disclaimer because they have not (and have no financial incentive to) tested if any gets into the egg, and then done a safety trial on people eating those eggs.   Ivermectin is a human medication.  It has been taken billions of times by millions of people.  It won the nobel prize for its use in humans.  It also happens to be used in virtually all other animals because there is nothing species specific about its mechanism or safety profile.  Calling it \"mainly a wormer cattle drench\" can only be deliberate dishonesty.",

Maybe some politicians thought like that but they got suggestions to discourage masks from people who really thought that they are not effective (based on studies et al.). Even now we are not sure how helpful the masks are. I estimate a weak effect, mostly good in crowded placed with poor ventilation. It might be the case that improving ventilation gives much higher protection that makes masks practically useless in such conditions. But because we rely on masks too much, there is not enough attention to ventilation issues that the total effect might be even slightly negative compared to a hypothetical world where we don't use masks but have learned aerosol spread much earlier.\n\nI have no doubts that many people in these organizations are competent and have good intentions. But due to bureaucratic nature and also because this science is really hard, they couldn't provide effective recommendations.",

Why do the reasons given line up so well with the prior science as well as the WHO (flu) pandemic advice?\n\n2) Why was PPE so scarce if it's such a game changer? Really think about this question and remember all the morality tales around the masks \"You are killing people if you don't wear one\", \"Czech Republic beat Corona with wearing masks\" and so on. IF masking was so effective why weren't doctors stocked up? Why weren't health authorities stocked up? Remember that your thesis is that they thought masks worked but wanted to save them for medical personnel. So why did they have so little?\n\nThe truth is that the evidence for masks was always very weak. Studies couldn't even find a protective effect for surgeons wearing them while operating. It's been a puzzle for science because according to logic they should work much better than they seem to. \n",

It would be absolutely devastating to have a bad vaccine - it could have done as much or much more damage than COVID itself.. The vaccine had to be extremely, extremely safe, over the entire worlds population with all of the genetic diversity, pre existing diseases, diets, environmental factors, age and on. There is absolutely no magical way to design a study that will effectively capture a small effect in a population that varied - the only realistic response is a lot of caution and a slow rollout. Like its so easy to sit here on a comment thread talking shit about the FDA 2 years later when we know the vaccines are safe, but we did not know that then. T",

Safety studies are designed with sufficient statistical power (= number of people enrolled, basically) so that any missing bad side effects are by definition less common than the equally negative outcomes of what you're trying to treat.  So in this case, they enrolled enough people in the COVID vaccine studies so that any deadly side effects they missed because of the limited size of the study would be rarer than dying of COVID itself.  That's actually why those studies had to be so big and took so long.  When you are studying a therapy for a much deadlier disease, you can use smaller studies, because it's more OK to miss a deadly side effect that occurs with a higher rate of incidence.",

I really don't get why there isn't more amazement and wonder at this.  I remember when AIDS came calling, and people were desperate for treatment, prevention, anything. It took *years* before there was anything even half-assed.  I think the first genuinely effective protease inhibitor was maybe 15 years after we recognised the disease?  That's a long, long time to wait.  It *could* have been the case this time, but it wasn't.

            "body": "\"If we want to make people more willing to get vaccines, or less willing to take ivermectin, we have to make the scientific establishment feel less like an enclave of hostile aliens to half the population. Do that, and people will mostly take COVID-related advice, for the same reason they mostly take advice around avoiding asbestos or using sunscreen - both things we‚Äôve successfully convinced people to do even without having a perfect encapsulation of the scientific method or the ideal balance between evidence and authority.\"\n\nPurely hypothetically, do you honestly doubt that if certain IDW influencers randomly decided to gin up sunscreen or asbestos-removal opposition as a culture war issue, then we wouldn't subsequently see widespread opposition to sunscreen and asbestos removal among their followers? People might even start mocking the weirdos who randomly decided sunscreen is anti-American, at which point this vicious condescension would be all the proof anti-screeners need that elites look down on them and their values, further entrenching sunscreen opposition as an essential pillar of their identity.   These grievances and suspicions aren't fixed essential flashpoints that can be traced back to significant divisions in the tribes and their values. They can be turned on and off like a light switch, especially thanks to a relatively new insatiable economy of culture war influencers chasing clicks.  (As others have pointed out, many holdouts were fine with mandated alien implants until less a year ago, others have argued that mRNA vaccines are actually *new* and that's what makes them alien and suspicious but that doesn't change the fact that very similar implant *mandates* were just an assumed normal part of life explicitly defended by conservatives like Ben Shapiro and the Federalist and now overnight mandates became unconscionable tyranny.) \n\nThe entirely alien analogy suffers from a flaw that emerges in a lot Scott's writing where he seems to just assume the Blue Tribe and its aligned elites are the prime movers of these dynamics and on some level nearly all polarization and animus emerges from what they do or don't do (and subsequently how the Red Tribe has to helplessly respond in kind), completely ignoring the fact that the Red Tribe actually does have an agency all its own to play offense in the culture wars. It's like seeing a Hatfield attack a McCoy, then witnessing a McCoy attack a Hatfield in retaliation, then writing 10,000 words about how the Hatfields started this whole thing and they really need to learn to be more charitable to the McCoys and take their grievances seriously. The Hatfields might well have started it but that's a hell of an intractable, difficult question that can't just be assumed because that's the first attack you saw or you feel some collective guilt as a Hatfield yourself. \n\n Is there anything in the alien analogy where anti-alien famous people confidently, loudly pronounce that quantum plague memetic deaths will remain at zero or hold steady at like 15 cases, then at one point 3000 people start dying of the quantum memetic plague every single day? Or how about anti-alienists compulsively repeat debunked canards about how actually the quantum plague is no worse than a common tachyonic sinus infection with a 99 percent survival rate while ignoring the inherent risk of unknown memetic plagues having unknown long-term consequences while *simultaneously* arguing the the memetic plague is actually a fiendishly designed bioweapon that the aliens are deliberately deploying to wipe us out? What if anti-alien media outlets start encouraging anti-alienists to harass and intimidate aliens and the people allied with them by calling the cops on people they see wearing memetic plague blocking space helmets. What if in addition to trumpeting the (human created) vaccine, anti-aliens had also aggressively promoted ginko, ginseng, forsythia, and oleandrin as cures for the memetic plague *before* they ever settled on the ambiguously effective human vaccines as their go to miracle cure? (I mean these as all as honest questions as my adhd forced me to kind of skim the last section and I may have missed something) Would you still say they were basically being reasonable if using flawed reasoning? If all these things had happened as a human I might still have my suspicions of the implants but( if my identity weren't completely emotionally wrapped around anti-alienism) I'd have to admit that my fellow human alien skeptics had behaved far worse and gotten more wrong than even the smug imperious aliens. It's one thing to interrogate the myriad failings of scientific elites, its something else entirely to do so while seemingly ignoring the record of even worse miserable failure and arguably unprovoked culture war aggression that emanates from the opposition to medical/scientific elites. It's something that looks a lot more like rationalization rather than rationalism. \n\nI think I understand at least some of the inchoate anxieties that drive people to vaccine opposition or Ivermectin boosterism. I've struggled with crippling anxiety, sometimes about unknown chemicals, my entire life. I also live in a fairly conservative area and I've had two people I respect and care about approach me and vent their vaccine fears and subtly ask me for advice, which vaccine I'd gotten etc. Imo just on that small sample size there are some relatively organic fears (as opposed to the ginned up ones)  that are far stranger, somewhat a-partisan, and in weird way deeper rooted than just these particular noisy culture war flare ups between medical elites and IDW influencers. I get that all Ivermectin boosters and vaccine skeptics aren't necessarily the worst Joe Rogan types but I think we very nearly approached a limit where the persuadable Fauci-skeptics have already bitten the bullet and gotten vaccinated and what's left just isn't very amenable to reason. \n",

Trump bet the farm on vaccines - to the point where he felt no other intervention was necessary.  Operation Warp Speed was his big initiative. He was all about it. And... it was successful.\n\nHis base didn't buy it.  They should be screaming from the rooftops that Trump delivered us from the pandemic and Biden is riding in his coattails.  But they're not.  Why?  Because the Red Tribe has lost control of their base.\n\nMajoree Taylor Green and her ilk are NOT the Right Tribe's elite or their thought leaders.  She is a symptom of the cancer in the Red Tribe.  The House of Reps is a clown show, and always has been (read Alexis de Tocqueville nothing changes!). \n\nSo yes, I think the criticism that the Blue Tribe deserves some blame here is valid.  I don't think they're alone in the criticism, and I don't think Scott is claiming that either.  \n",

That completely falls apart if you were to take the extra step of adding all the failed predictions and wildly uncharitable things said by the Red Tribe *at the same time* (cases down to zero in March 2020, \"Covid is their new Hoax\", \"as bad as the flu\", \"hydrochloroquine is the cure, \"Oleandrin is the cure\").

This is generally my bar for statistical explanations: real things tend to come screaming out of the data. Cigarettes cause cancer. Lead is bad for children. Seat belts save lives.

After Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz pointed out problems with many of the studies, ivmmeta.com published a response to him (sidebar \"Respones\", ctrl-F \"GMK\"). I don't have the time and energy to address the object-level issues in the studies. However, I did a quick search for \"We note that this personality [GMK] has an extensive history of incorrect advice, including for example...\" and found out that all the examples given were manipulative or outright false (read: pure slander). That was it for me. If they lie or manipulate with something easily checkable (whether X ever said Y), why should I believe them in subtle statistical issues?",

            "body": "Firstly, thanks for writing about Ivermectin. I've had no particular opinion on this from the start, but have a friend who got very into it, and I never had the energy to dive in and try to figure out what's really going on. I feel now that there's no need to, because I can't find anything obviously suspect about anything you've written.\n\nSecondly, I think you are way over-analyzing the vaccine thing. I am not vaccinated and there's very simple reasons why: I don't trust the claims of safety. The reasons are very simple:\n\n1. Most of the people I know who took the (mRNA) vaccines told me the shot made them very sick for a day, sometimes two, sick enough that they couldn't get out of bed. One time a bunch of us met up in a bar, and one friend didn't turn up. Another said that she was getting her shot today and everyone just sort of nodded, right, that explains it. Of course you can't go party on the day you get your shot.\n\nThis is not the definition of \"safe\", this is what the word \"toxic\" means. As far as I can tell nobody tracks these events or cares, people are being told to expect them and there zero credible investigations of these sorts of events.\n\n2. Through my girlfriend, I know a group of women in the 20s and 30s and many of them now have messed up periods. For one, her period has vanished entirely for months. For others it's changed, and one now bleeds almost all the time. \n\nNone of them have formally reported this, doctors are basically telling them to go away (\"maybe it'll get better\") and this is true even in the case where the doctor herself said she had exactly the same problem. Menstrual problems are one of the top class of AEs reported to VAERs get as far as the system is concerned, they don't happen and the vaccines are totally safe.\n\nI will shout this to make it 150% clear - I CAN SEE PEOPLE AROUND ME GETTING INJURED. I can also see that this does NOT surface in any official or formal scientific capacity and the databases of adverse events are being totally ignored; papers that try to use them tend to get retracted for bullshit reasons like \"you aren't allowed to assume causation in this dataset\", even though assuming causation is the only reason those datasets are collected in the first place.\n\nMy problem isn't that I perceive scientists as mystical advanced aliens with unknowable motivations. I understand the science behind this stuff just fine and have done paper reviews myself before. My problem is that I perceive them, alongside journalists and public health officials, as having succumbed to a quasi-cult like mindset in which absolutely nothing may be allowed to slow down the vaccine rollout. Because tradeoffs are hard, they just refuse to admit they're making one at all by claiming there basically aren't any safety concerns. And then when people  look around them and think, \"um then why does it make people sick\" they just get forced to take it anyway.\n\nYou don't have to be some anti-science rube to realize that what's going on here isn't science. Science means collecting data and asking questions. I see no data being collected and anyone who asks questions is immediately purged. ",

                    "body": "I had an adverse effect to cetirizine (Zyrtec) - after taking it for some time, trying to withdraw the medication caused intense itching all over my body.  I looked it up online and at the time there was not much on it - intense searching turned up like two or three comments on obscure forums complaining about the same thing.  One person suggested weaning off of it with decreasing dosages, so there I was in my kitchen chopping up cetirizine pills into quarters like a crazy person.  It worked though - two weeks of less-intense itching, and only one of my students asked what was wrong with me that I kept scratching my face... good times.\n\nAnyway that was about eight years ago.  Now cetirizine withdrawal is a recognized side effect with real studies on it.\n\nSo this is what people are talking about when we say it can take time for side effects to come out.  Some very low-probability events happen, even fewer people report them, and then it takes a while (years) for enough of that to get enough attention for someone to put the Official Stamp on it.  And I'd guess it would be even worse for women given assertions I've come across that doctors are more likely to ignore or disregard women's self-reported symptoms than men's.\n\nAnyway, I opted for the Sinopharm vaccine in part because it's made using technologies that have been time-tested more thoroughly (and in part because it was the first available in my country of residence and I didn't want to travel, or wait an unknown number of weeks, for an mRNA vaccine) and I'm happy with my decision.  I had a mild breakthrough infection about six months after vaccination, but no hospitalization, so that was basically in line with expectations.\n\nFWIW, some people think the mRNA dosages are too high and that's why the side effects are so bad.  This is another thing that could be worked out with more time.  But of course time was not on our side here and rushing the vaccines out was probably the best move (in fact I would have rushed them out even faster).",

After two years I've never had COVID and the people who did have it all told me it's basically a heavy cold. \n\nI'm reminded here of the introduction of aspirin. It's a little known theory, but there's a claim that the second/third waves of Spanish Flu were so bad because they occurred around the time when aspirin was new on the market. At the time it was marketed as a wonder drug and doctors were known to prescribe doses to those who were sick that we now know today were radically over what is safe. They didn't know that at the time, of course. The belief is thus that at least some of the Spanish Flu deaths were related to aspirin overdoses.\n\nI tried once to figure out how the mRNA doses were calculated, once I noticed that Moderna was 3x the level of Pfizer. No dice. The closest information I could find suggested that they may have started¬†with with levels that were not deadly in animals, and then worked upwards until the effects became intolerable. That is, the doses aren't calibrated to give you a lesser impact than infection itself, partly because there's no good way to numerically compare the two.",

                                    "body": "No, that's nonsense. I think we need to take a few steps back here. The point of a vaccine is to protect you from a disease *without* requiring you to suffer through the nasty effects of actually having it. The ideal vaccine imposes no side effects at all and yields perfect protection. And not coincidentally, that this is exactly how COVID vaccines are marketed - quick, painless, perfectly safe and completely protective.\n\nWhat you're arguing here is that benefit of a medical intervention is always proportional to its unpleasantness. Which is just nonsense. Medicine is filled with treatments that have very few side effects yet which are highly effective. Before 2021 this was also normal for vaccines - I don't recall ever having a serious side effect from any of the vaccines I've taken. The continuous attempt to rewrite history and redefine basic terms (see Merriam-Webster's change to the dictionary definition of vaccine at the start of the year), is exactly the kind of behaviour that makes people regard COVID vaccines with such great suspicion. \n\nYour chemotherapy non-sequitur is a good example of that. People \"expect\" it to suck but they would absolutely prefer a treatment that was equally as effective minus the hair loss. And nobody takes chemotherapy if they aren't already very sick, exactly because of the side effects. This just has nothing to do with the current topic of mass administered prophylactics like the COVID \"vaccines\" or ivermectin.",

They kind of have to, since the whole goal here is trashing DNA replication, so *anything* that's fast-dividing, like your hair cells or lining of the gut, gets trashed along with the cancer cells.  Nobody has yet figured out how to screw with the DNA replication of *only* cancer cells, although there are some amazing potentialities out there perhaps with micro RNAs and CRISPR-Cas9 tech:\n\nhttps://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/crispr-cancer-research-treatment\n\nBut there are also a burgeoning number of biologicals which are making their way into the clinic, e.g. the justly famous CAR-T treatment, and *these* are indeed often far more targeted and do far less collateral damage. When one of these works it's like a freaking miracle cure.\n\nI believe most other new non-chemotherapy therapies are along the lines of inhibitors -- they slow down or stop cancer growth, but they do not actually kill cancer cells (although slowing them down might allow the immune system to catch up, I would guess, and is a very worthy goal in itself).  You need chemo for that (or the biologicals, or radiation), I believe, although this field is sufficiently complex I speak under correciton if anyone knows better.",

If it's not clamped down properly then it wants to unfurl itself into a more stable configuration. So a plain old vial of spike proteins wouldn't last long enough to be a viable vaccine.\n\nThere was one vaccine candidate (CSL/University of Queensland) that consisted of a spike protein clamped to a strong backbone which stopped it unfurling. Unfortunately, they made the strong backbone out of a fragment of HIV (!?!) and as a result, vaccinated people started testing false positive for HIV, so they abandoned that particular vaccine rather than screw up all the world's HIV tests. \n",

Secondly, it's not clear the presence of *any* viral particles (or components) is necessary for an inflammatory reponse.  The body does that all the time in response to a wide range of insult or injury, only some of which are viral infections, and sometimes for no reason at all (alas).   We don't know how exactly inflammation gets started, but it's reasonable to assume cells have some way of noticing when abnormal things are going on and they send out cytokines annnouncing that fact -- which is what inflammation is.  What are they noticing?  How are they noticing it?  This we don't really know in great detail. I mean, it would be great if we did, since inflammation in general contributes mightily to all kinds of poor outcomes.",

I get the same side effects warnings for the flu shot. It makes sense - most of the side effects are due to your own immune response, and the whole point of vaccines is to provoke an immune repose. \n\nThere‚Äôs also a degree of confirmation bias - fatigue and muscle soreness aren‚Äôt exactly unheard of for the average adult, and are normally written off.

For people I know in Switzerland, where 40% are with Moderna, it's very different. Here I think I only know one person who took the vaccine and doesn't seem to have felt sick. When I rack my brains to think of everyone who's taken it, most of them seem to report side effects I'd consider severe.\n\nAs for knowledge being suppressed - suppressed is the wrong word. Ignored is more like it. I've not yet seen any kind of systematic effort to track side effects in the real world by governments, beyond running these databases they work so hard to ignore. Yet, these are brand new technologies. Moderna as recently as 2017 was failing to proceed past animal trials because repeat doses of anything mRNA was too toxic. That's not good! You'd expect given such a risky technology that it'd be watched like a hawk and there'd be massive monitoring efforts but there's none, because the authorities won't be *anything* that could reduce vaccine uptake. Up until the last few weeks they have barely even acknowledged that anything can go wrong at all.\n\nBTW I'm not talking about fatigue and muscle soreness. I'm talking about \"so sick you cannot work or get out of bed\". I'm talking about \"I thought I was dying\" level sick - that's a literal quote from someone I overheard telling a friend about why they'd vanished for a week after their first shot. I know one couple who took the vaccine *after* they'd had COVID out of some sense of duty to society, back when they were being told the vaccines were sterilizing so this made sense. The woman said she once they started talking about boosters she was done and would never take one again, because she simply cannot be taking a day off work feeling like crap every few months for a disease she's too young to be affected by.\n\nI don't think \"having to take a day off work every few months\" is in any way a normal vaccine experience, nor should it be. Yet, it seems like this is the experience of the clear majority of people I know who took it (not 100% of them).\n\nBut the biggest problem is - why do people get so sick? Are they really recovering fully after this experience? Nobody seems to know or care to find out. Given I perceive myself as being at zero risk from COVID this just seems like a terribly, terribly poor set of tradeoffs.",

I can share my anecdotes: \n\nOf the 50 or so odd people I've had conversations with in person and know well in real life (through work, social clubs, sports, etc) I can report:\n\n1. Those who received Moderna had strong reactions and were generally sick the day after.  A few reported fever, a few nausea, etc.  All recovered quickly and all really only reported the severe reaction to one of the shots not both.\n\n2. Those who received any of the other shots generally reported little to no effect.  My wife and I (30s) received Pfizer.  She had no effect really and continues to menstruate healthily.  I was groggy headed the next day and was fine after that.\n\nSo my anecdotal world is extremely different than yours.  I'm from the US if it matters and the age range of folks I'm interacting with is 30 - 50.\n\nEither way, VAERS offers an objective way to look into this information.  I searched for all incidents of menstruation reported issues in the database resulting from COVID 19.  There were 697 reported cases of menstruation issues in VAERS.  \n\n697 out of 201,922 women in the US 18-49 who have reported to VAERS after receiving the COVID-19 shot.  0.3% incidence.  \n\nThe literature I can find reports 5% - 35% incidence of menstruation irregularity in this age range depending on a range of factors, including stress.  \n\nWhile I appreciate the anecdotes you shared, when I include them in with the 201,922 other anecdotes shared in VAERS it appears you just happened to have some very unlucky or stressed female friends and have not uncovered a hidden side effect plaguing the hundreds of millions of women who have received mRNA vaccines.

VAERS, I have absolutely zero confidence in those figures. The reporting rate even before COVID was very low and COVID has seen vaccines and vaccine promotion be elevated well past \"moral imperative\" and into \"we will punish you severely if you don't do it\" territory. Of the women I know, zero of them appear to have reported it to AE databases, in fact I doubt they even know such databases exist let alone how to do it. Actually even I don't know if there's a national AE database in this country! But even in the USA I simply do not believe these numbers are anywhere close to accurate.\n\nBeyond the general mass hysteria around anything to do with COVID or vaccines, there's another reason I suspect this. I've seen two op-eds written by women that talked about this problem. Both of them explicitly asked \"are we allowed to talk about this\" and both of them explicitly stated that the problem was not only affecting them but many of their friends. This \"it's hit me and my friends and my doctor\" type anecdote is just far too common for the VAERS data to be correct. Given a choice between believing women who have no agenda or are actively afraid of sounding the alarm, and the US public health authorities, I choose the former every time.",

I signed up and since then I receive text messages every couple days in the beginning, then weekly, now only monthly.  \n\nOne time I reported having an infection that for all intents and purposes I could see no reason why it would be related to my covid vaccine months ago.  I received a phone call from VAERs within 2 days of submitting the report.  They gathered more information about my infection and how I treated it, and then we moved on.\n\nThis is an audited, public database.  I certainly agree that participation is fairly low (way more than 220k women 18-49 have been vaccinated, including my wife who did not participate in VAERs), but it is also certainly statistically significant. \n\n  ",

            "body": "Well, while I'm patting myself on the back, let me repost a comment of mine from the September post \"Too Good To Check: A Play In Three Acts\" where I was trawling through the Cochrane meta-study:\n\t\nDeiseach Sep 7\n(6) India (different study):\n\nDISCUSSION: In this study we did not observe any benefit of adding ivermectin to the hydroxychloroquine in the management of patients of SARS-CoV-2 resistant to standard care treatment. Our finding are based on small cohort of asymptomatic or patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.Such patients were recruited when they did not responded to the standard treatment. Ivermectin was tested as an adjuvant drug to the standard treatment with hydroxychloroquine. On comparisons of patients receiving hydroxychloroquine plus ivermectin with the patients receiving hydroxychloroquine alone, no significant difference was observed in the cure rates. There were no significant adverse effects were observed in patients receiving ivermectin. The use of ivermectin 12 mg single dose as an adjuvant to standard treatment was based on the widespread uncontrolled studies that suggested that the ivermectin has antiviral activity against a broad range of viruses. .Based on these studies it was concluded that ivermectin's nuclear transport inhibitory activity may be effective against SARS-CoV-2.\n\n(This is one of those \"throw it against the wall and see what sticks\" studies; ivermectin didn't do much but that's not what they were studying. Result here neutral again, I think).\n\n(7) Argentina:\n\nFindings: The trial run between May 18 and September 29, 2020 with 45 randomized patients (30 in the IVM group and 15 controls). There was no difference in viral load reduction between groups but a significant difference in reduction was found in patients with higher median plasma IVM levels (72% IQR 59 ‚Äì 77) versus untreated controls (42% IQR 31 ‚Äì 73) (p=0¬∑004). The mean ivermectin plasma concentration levels also showed a positive correlation with viral decay rate (r:0¬∑47, p=0¬∑02). Adverse events were reported in 5 (33%) patients in the controls and 13 (43%) in the IVM treated group, without a relationship between IVM plasma levels and adverse events.\n\nInterpretation: A concentration dependent antiviral activity of oral high dose IVM was identified in this pilot trial at a dosing regimen that was well tolerated. Large trials with clinical endpoints are necessary to determine the clinical utility of IVM in COVID-19.\n\n(This one contradicts the Bangladesh and Spain studies about reductions in viral load, but it does show 'something something need high doses').\n\n(8) Colombia:\n\nFindings: In this randomized clinical trial that included 476 patients, the duration of symptoms was not significantly different for patients who received a 5-day course of ivermectin compared with placebo (median time to resolution of symptoms, 10 vs 12 days; hazard ratio for resolution of symptoms, 1.07).\n\nMeaning: The findings do not support the use of ivermectin for treatment of mild COVID-19, although larger trials may be needed to understand effects on other clinically relevant outcomes.\n\n(And this one contradicts the Indian 5-day trial. They don't seem to have seen a positive effect re: mortality, and they did manage to screw up the 'which group gets what' dosing. Read the whole thing: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2777389)\n\n(9) India (different study):\n\nIn our study subjects, Ivermectin did not improve the time to symptom recovery, clinical status at day 14, or hospital-free days at day 28 after drug administration. Similar results were observed in the only other randomized-trial of Ivermectin (12 ¬µg/kg) in predominantly mild COVID-19 patients (n=62) in Bangladesh, wherein Podder et al(19) found that Ivermectin failed to hasten the resolution of symptoms compared to usual care. The same investigators repeated RT-PCR only once on day 10 and found that most patients had attained a negative result(19). In contrast, we performed RT-PCR at days 3, 5 and 7 to serially evaluate decline in viral load with Ivermectin. Our rationale was that faster viral load decline may enable the non-severe COVID-19 patient to become non-infectious sooner, thereby limiting the contagion. Indeed, it has been shown that at a lower viral load (CT > 24), infectivity declines with lower viral culture positivity(20). Hence the trend towards increased viral negativity at day 5 with ivermectin 24 mg in our trial, particularly among mildly ill patients, encourages further exploration in this regard.\n\nIn a retrospective study of hospitalized patients in Florida(21), patients who received Ivermectin were found to have a significantly lower mortality that those who did not (15% versus 25%). The mortality benefit remained significant after propensity-matched analysis and adjusting for confounders. However, they included patients with greater illness severity than our study population, illustrated by lack of mortality in our trial. Furthermore, the greater use of concurrent therapies and retrospective design preclude drawing definitive conclusions from their data. Nonetheless, we did find a 56.2-61.5% RT-PCR negativity among moderately ill patients who received Ivermectin at day 5 of enrolment. The immunomodulatory rather than antiviral effect of Ivermectin may be hypothetically more important in moderate and severe COVID-19\n\n(Interesting results that you get more bang for your buck, as it were, if you take your ivermectin after a meal and with booze. Again, some contradictory findings).\n\nI'm not going to go through the whole list, but going by this, if you want ivermectin to work, then you should be in India (parts thereof), Bangladesh, or Florida.",

Also, about half the people I know are creationists, but a surprising number of them are conversant with science and expertise - both the immunologist kind where experts wear white lab coats, and the plumber kind where experts keep the immunologists from sloshing through poop on the walk to the metro.\n\nMy personal feeling, and that of all the thoughtful vaccine-hesitant and ivermectin-curious people I've talked to about it (n~=10) is that I'm very angry at the authority-experts, I feel manipulated and spoken down to and frankly betrayed.  If anyone is treating anyone like a horse, it's the elites who want to herd me into the corral.  I couldn't care less if it's for my own good, or even if they're right about it - I resent being treated like cattle.  The risk I perceive from a little vaccine hesitancy (I got the shot when it became convenient, but no sooner, and I don't even remember which one) and a little ivermectin curiosity (I've never even seen ivermectin but I wouldn't turn it down if someone passed me some at a party) is very low, and it trolls the Confident Ones so it seems like a pretty safe way to vent my anger and resentment at them.",

But it's also true that I do encourage that anger a little, and it's because I don't want to just get used to it.  Every time I make a choice about my future, I want to take into account that there are big powerful forces trying to herd me.  Maybe it's my own weakness, but it's easy to forget that when the proof isn't right in front of you and right now you just have to make a choice and it would be so convenient to go with the herd without even noticing it.\n\nBut that's not why I post comments like this - i.e. \"troll\" the authority-elites, though \"troll\" is probably too harsh a term.  I have the impression that my blind spots are different than the norm in places like this (e.g., I hang out with creationists, I have long talks over beer with blue collar types, etc.)  I'm a committed rationalist (for example I first read the Sequences long ago and I read them yearly for a while) so I think my perspective is not only different, but also compatible.  (Symmetrically, I do the same thing with my less rationalist friends.  There are plenty of Confident Ones on all sides.)  If I had more time, I'd write more, but as it is I contribute occasional comments when I see a hole, like in Scott's social takeaway.",

The agency organised a fake hepatitis vaccination campaign in Abottabad, Pakistan, in a bid to obtain DNA from the children of Bin Laden, to confirm the presence of the family in a compound and sanction the rollout of a risky and extensive operation. Release of this information has had a disastrous effect on worldwide eradication of infectious diseases, especially polio.\n\nOn May 16, 2014, the White House announced that the CIA will no longer use vaccination programmes as a cover for espionage. The news comes in the wake of a series of militant attacks on polio vaccination workers in Pakistan, with legitimate health-care workers targeted as being US spies. The attacks have forced organisations such as the UN to suspend polio vaccination efforts in Pakistan, and have severely hampered anti-polio efforts, with parents refusing to have their children vaccinated. News of the vaccination programme led to a banning of vaccination in areas controlled by the Pakistan Taliban, and added to existing scepticism surrounding the sincerity of public health efforts by the international health community.\n\nConsequently, WHO declared that polio has re-emerged as a public health emergency in Pakistan‚Äîone of only three countries, including Afghanistan and Nigeria, where the disease remains endemic. According to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, 61 of 77 cases of polio reported this year have been in Pakistan, and cases of paralytic polio have spiked, with 66 cases reported up to now, compared with only 14 last year.\n\nThe lesson learned from the experience in Pakistan is that public health programmes should be politically neutral. Although the announcement from the White House might go some way to building bridges towards that neutrality, health officials and local leaders now have the challenge of convincing communities that vaccination is not merely beneficial, but vital for children.\"",

Here are the ages of those I could guess from their position were involved in the decision to assassinate Osama bin Laden in the Obama Administration and invade Iraq in the Bush Jr. Administration:\n\n(1) Assassinate Bin Laden, age in 2011:\nPres Obama 50\nSecState Clinton 64\nSecDef Gates 68\nAG Holder 60\nNSA Donilon 56\nDNI Clapper 70\nCoS Daley 63\nUN Amb Rice 47\n\nAverage age 59.8\n\n(2) Invade Iraq, age in 2003:\nPres Bush 57\nSecState Powell 66\nSecDef Rumsfeld 71\nAG Ashcroft 61\nNSA Rice 49\nDCI Tenet 50\nCoS Card 56\nUN Amb Negroponte 64\n\nAverage age 59.3\n\nNo difference at all.  (Note that for this to be a reasonable test, I picked out  the people I thought might be involved before I looked up their ages.)\n\nI only say \"to a first approximation\" because I don't actually know how either decision was made in  detail, and who was involved, and if I did the key people and their ages might be different.   My vague impression is that Obama listened more closely to his younger staff members, because he thought he represented a new younger wave of power like JFK (\"We are the ones we've  been waiting for\") while Bush listened more closely to his older staff members, because he saw his Presidency as a continuation of traditions.  But that's just a vague personal impression, no substitute for actual knowledge of either man, or either decision.\n",

(This of course will not help if you have an existence proof only or can solve SAT in O(n^200).)\n\n\nAlso, it seems like most people faking data (that we know about) are much less science literate than the people checking them. Carlisle-Stouffer-Fisher and GRIM detection could both be avoided when the fakers would go to the trouble of actually simulating a study instead of just making up percentages on the spot, I guess?\n\nOf course, if you have to publish your raw data, this becomes a lot harder, as people could sanity check any correlations in your sample, e.g. between obesity and smoking. The best way to fake data then might be to take past real patient data, randomly assign them to intervention and control group and discard 30% of death in the intervention group.\n\nTo detect this, you would basically have to deanonymize patient data so that people could check the actual outcomes, I guess? Which basically would mean employing a trusted intermediary somehow? ",

            "body": "I think I get where you're coming from with the hostile alien analogy, but the problem is that I immediately put myself in the place of the hostile aliens and started thinking of how I'd have to act to convince the idiot humans to take their brain implants.  I don't think your point, though, was that we should imagine anti-vaxxers as members of a less-technologically advanced species that couldn't understand vaccine science *even in principle* and therefore had to be coddled somehow to coax them into doing what we paternalistically knew was best for them.\n\nRather, I *think* your point was that we should try to imagine what it would be like to have someone who a) didn't have your best interests at heart and b) was totally convinced of their own superiority and c) spoke in some kind of vague or obscuritan manner and made arguments that they seemed to be convinced by but that didn't seem to make sense or seemed to satisfy some alien set of epistemological standards that I had never agreed to.\n\nAnd for that, I don't imagine hostile aliens.  I imagine Orthodox priests.  Orthodox priests have told us that it's not possible to get covid - or any other disease - by sharing a communion spoon because (if I understand the argument) something about the transubstantiation process (that is, when the wine becomes the blood of Christ) purifies the wine of all disease.  They visit covid wards in hospitals and burn incense and splash holy water onto the covid patients.  They say vaccines are a personal choice but what will really protect us from covid is prayer.  During Georgia's first wave, when we had one of the lowest covid rates in the world, they told us it was because God had chosen Georgia for protection because Georgian Orthodoxy was the one true religion, and then during the consecutive four waves, three of which were among the world's most severe ever, they were conspicuously silent on the theological implications of that fact.\n\nIf the Orthodox Priests announced a special purifying ritual that could cure covid and demanded that everyone go do the ritual, I would not go.  Even though the Orthodox Church is the most trusted institution in Georgian society by far and the Patriarch is the most trusted individual by far.  Even though most of my neighbors and in-laws would go.  Even though people would take the fact that I was not going as a sign of recklessness and some would cry and pray for my poor children who would be exposed to covid solely because of my refusal to go and do a simple, painless ritual with no side effects conducted by the best and most trustworthy people in society, I would not go.  Even though I know that \"special Orthodox ritual\" is 100% safe - safer than a vaccine, even - I would not go.\n\nI know the \"science=religion\" comparison is stupid and tired and was never a good analogy, BUT lots of detractors of the \"hostile alien\" establishment view us as promoting our own version of a religion, with Fauci as our Patriarch and, I don't know, Karl Marx as our Jesus.  And the problem is there's literally nothing anyone could do that could make me believe that the Georgian Orthodox Church could cure covid with a ritual, and if someone brought me very convincing evidence I would sooner believe that I was mistaken in my interpretation of the evidence than in my belief that religion can't cure sickness with miracles.\n\nSo unless the government passed a law that I couldn't work or go to the movies or whatever without my Miracle Ritual Certificate, I wouldn't get one.  If they did pass such a law my first impulse would be to see if I could just buy the certificate without doing the ritual.  But assuming good enough fraud-proofing I'd just do the stupid ritual and get on with my life.  So there's my argument for vaccine mandates.  But of course I'd oppose - and vote against - Miracle Ritual mandates!\n\nJust for me, I think this is a better fit for what the inside view looks like for an anti-vaxxer: Vaccine proponents aren't technologically advanced, superior aliens - they're weird priests with funny clothes and meaningless rituals and bad epistemology who very obviously just want to subjugate us for the purpose of money, power, and prestige, who respond famously poorly when their authority is challenged, and who hold inexplicable and damaging influence over society mainly though corruption and indoctrination, and who might at any time decide to try to force us all to participate in their rituals.\n\nThe way anti-vaxxers act towards vaccines is more or less exactly the way I act towards Christian rituals, and the way they react to discussion of mandates is more or less exactly the way I react to discussion of things like blasphemy laws.\n\nThen I guess the question becomes: how much does the \"inside view\" matter, and how much does reality matter?  How confident should I be that I'm right that vaccines do work, and Christian Miracle Rituals don't work?  How does one move society towards the correct opinion in each case?  That seems to be an unsolved problem.",

And most of them are further prepared to concede that medical science in particular also generates working mechanisms. Rather than throwing out the whole edifice,  they're looking for reasons to throw out elements piecemeal, without expertise relating to how participants in the edifice of science judge evidence.\n\nIn a symmetrical situation, you'd be challenging the orthodox church on its record on Covid, while acknowledging that orthodox miracle-powered airplanes and such are obviously real.",

Here I would argue that the \"The vaccines are safe no matter what\" crowd has essentially cost lives.\n--I believe they work adequately, but less well then advertized. There is a certain range of +-15% here you can fudge/interpret the data. In particular, immunological theory would predict that a 1 protein vaccine (mRNA)would be far more susceptible to pathogen escape then a multi proteine (Vektor or conventional) vaccine.  I cannot see any biological reason why Pfizer could possibly be better against Delta, which is characterized by no less then 3 mutations on the spike protein, and where you would expect a massive drop of immunity, then any of the vektor or conventional vaccines which also make use of other proteins.  Now, one can make a case that Pfizer is just covering up adverse reactions, and that the real adverse reactions are far harsher then advertized and thus there is a stronger immune response. \nBut Pfizer essentially claims to be better against variants with mutated spike proteins, inspite of only showing the spike protein, also claiming less adverse reactions and higher efficacy against baseline covid. \nEverything in immunology has tradeoffs. I call shenanigans. \nLike, 1 of these is likely, 2 is possible, all 3? With a very new technology while competing against serious scientific concurrence? \nIn my view highly unlikely.  There is also the issue that Pfizer, via their stranglehold on the EMA is blocking Sinovac, Sputnik or Indian vaccines in the EU.  I am pro Vax, but also pro Vax choice.\nIn particular, I want to avoid a situation where the authorities or their pharma allies can force me, at pain of not having a social live anymore, to pay tribute to them. \nForcing me to pay tribute to one of their adversaries, well, they would have far less incentives to keep this up in perpetuity. I would prefer a Chinese/Russian vaccine in the west, and a western vaccine in Russia/China.  Wanting to minimize control the authorities have over you is completely rational and in my logical self interest. If control is neccessary, I wish to minimize the incentives they have for keeping this control up indefinitly, and delivering resources to their adversaries would do just that. ",

I think it is the latter that explains what it's like to be anti-vax, whereas I think that most people just dismiss most cognitive dissonance without much trouble at all.\n\nThat said, one of the things about religion is that there is a core of like, fossilized common sense or something, which is dressed up in the trappings of nonsense, but which obviously functions in the real world, at least on human psychology, in a way that sustains and powers religion.  I would point to the fact that people still believe in God as approximately as surprising and mysterious as the miracle of powered human flight.\n\nI think you're right in general to point to the achievements of science as evidence that we should trust science, and to ask what comparable achievements the various religions have made.  But can't religious people just say \"well, we've saved ~3 billion souls from eternal damnation, and we'd be up to 4 billion if it weren't for obstinate miracle-deniers like yourself obstructing our efforts and spreading anti-miracle disinformation\"?\n\nObjectively religions have achieved a lot, in terms of observable effects in the real world - like building lots of churches, getting lots of people to fight wars on their behalf, raising lots of money, accumulating lots of political capital.  Heck, even I celebrate Christmas.\n\nIt's like:\nOrthodox Church: \"Family is important.\"  \nMe: \"Yeah.\" \nOC: \"Tradition and ritual are good ways to structure our lives.\"\nMe: \"Okay.\"\nOC: \"Murder and stealing and stuff are very bad.\"\nMe: \"Indeed!\"\nOC: \"Our churches and songs and artistic creations are very grand and beautiful.\"\nMe: \"No argument there.\"\nOC: \"I have special insight into morality because I was touched by someone who in turn was touched by someone etc. etc. in an unbroken line of touching that goes back to Jesus Christ, who was God but also God's son.\"\nMe: \"Wait, what was that last one again?\"\n\nEven committed atheists can acknowledge that the Church has achieved a lot - which makes the process of explaining why we should get rid of religion despite its achievements a bit complicated, and allows its proponents to paint us as unreasonable if we do so.",

Many large businesses‚Äô lobbies have demanded that any regulation affecting their products should be rooted in ‚Äúsound science.‚Äù On its surface, that demand seems reasonable. Why would anyone not want regulations to be based on the best available scientific knowledge? However, the implication of ‚Äúsound-science‚Äù policy is that no restrictive regulation of an industry can be developed until proof of harm is conclusively demonstrated.\n\nScientists are often not able to provide firm answers, especially for complex physiological and environmental phenomena ‚Äî and typically not in the time scales appropriate to policymaking. As a result, calls for ‚Äúsound science‚Äù end up being a delaying tactic that provides an advantage to the industrial firms producing risky products at the potential expense of humans and nonhuman species ‚Äî who may be needlessly exposed to potentially toxic substances during the decades spent ‚Äúproving‚Äù harm.\n\nPolitical scientism starkly divides societies into friends and enemies, the enlightened and the ignorant.\n\"\"\"\"",

A question: given the apparent low downside risks of taking ivermectin, would it not have been rational to use the drug? In other words, in the absence of evidence that it was harmful to use, given its long track record of non harmful use why not use? Of course, once we have decent reasons to think it does not good then why use it. But as you note, getting to this point was quite a journey. ",

Anyone who thought \"I don't want the vaccine, I'll just use ivermectin\" was 100% making the wrong decision.  Even if ivermectin *had* turned out to be slightly effective against Covid, preventing the disease is better than treating it.\n\n\"Ivermectin may help in some countries\" is an interesting fact worth sharing, but it's the sort of fact that belongs in the science section on page 3.  The fact that should go in 48-point bold on the front page is still \"THERE IS NO PILL AS EFFECTIVE AS A VACCINE.\" So I really can't fault how this got covered in the mainstream.\n\nIf everyone got vaccinated and we were just haggling over the marginal case of \"what is the optimal treatment protocol for breakthrough infections?\", the discourse would look a lot different.",

Moreover, I suspect that there was also a desire to embarras. Follow the science! I think that if you want people to follow the science then it is best to model scientific discussion. And in the case of Ivermectin the science at the time was not clear it does any good, but seems pretty anodyne. Just dont use it in place of vax.

Science requires debate and conversation - the same people who are intent on banning and suppressing \"disinformation\" are preventing legitimate discussion since censorship is a hammer and smashes ALL, both the legitimate discussing along with the illegitimate. Science takes time, and gets things wrong more often than right. Science requires we not get emotionally invested in what WE believe is the truth, because it may not be. Science requires dissent and people doing things differently - so please no vaccine mandates. After all, if there ARE long-term health effects from the mRNA covid vaccines, perhaps we should WANT a control group who hasn't had it, to compare outcomes with? Science requires providing data and letting others check your work - rather than hiding it and simply telling people that it's perfectly safe.\n\nI also hope to never hear the term \"expert\" again, or have the 'benevolent' government forcing things upon me for my own good. This whole pandemic response has destroyed my trust in virtually all institutions, and all I really want now is to be left alone, and allowed to make my own medical decisions... which for the first time in my life, I'm fearful will be stripped from me.

With that in mind, I think the political takeaway here needs a couple more points added to it: \n\n1. I don't know how many conferences at five star resorts on Tralfamadore or Coruscant the aliens have attended on the brain implant manufacturer's dime. \n2. I don't know the extent of industry capture in the aliens' medical device regulatory agencies. \n3. I don't know how much stock these aliens own in the company that manufactures the implant or what kind of swag the company's sales people (sales aliens?) might offer.  \n4. I don't know to what extent alien medical grant funding decisions are consolidated in a small number of people or agencies, which might be used to create a false image of consensus among the aliens.\n5. In short, it's hard for me to develop an accurate picture of what incentives the aliens face, and how those incentives might affect what they say publicly about the desirability of universal brain implants.   \n",

Once there were a couple different versions, there was, I'm sure, plenty of political pressure to start showing a positive ROI on all that money sooner rather than later, especially after people's hopes were raised in the interim by news of their development. \"We spent $10 billion on developing a novel vaccine, but we can't roll it out because it failed our safety review. You'll just have to wait longer, people\" is not a message politicians or the bureaucracy wants to have to deliver. On the flipside, nobody really has an incentive to favor ivermectin as a treatment option because it's off patent. \n\nAgain, I'm not saying this is an accurate or complete picture, I'm not saying it's a compelling picture, but I do think it's a plausible one and some people out there found it compelling.

In fact they are VERY corruptible. Decentralized decision making crates a robust, stable, outcome mesh. Centralized systems are very unstable, any mistake can extinguish human life. Just imagine the pfizer vax had the undesirable effect of making your sperm inert (we still don't know the full long term effects), and every man on earth took it. For another example of the fragility of centralized systems, look how the Incas (an extremely centralized civilization) were conquered by 20 spaniards when they kidnapped the Inca (emperor). But they couldn't beat the decentralized mapuche of southern Chile and Argentina in 300 years of war. The economy has also nice examples.",

Yes, eventually the FDA or the CDC need to take a position based on the outcome of that work, so in that sense there is centralization, but all of the other voices are still there and available.\n\nI do not believe a 10,000 couch doctors without any experience reviewing medical studies can perform an appropriate medical meta analysis.  \n\nI consider myself very bright, a natural skeptic, and aware of my own potential biases.  I would have missed a good number of the items that Scott raised in this article, let alone the countless more specific details that he either only eluded to or didn't even mention.  I just don't have the skills. \n\nSkills matter.  When it comes to golf I will bet on Tiger Woods over 100,000 randomly selected individuals any day.

            "body": "I think one element of the political takeaway that was understated is the idea of something like normalization of control, and how that plays into commands that are mentally bucketed with other commands.\n\nThe idea that the left (in the part of the government sense) loves to have as much control as possible and to overall put in as many restrictions as possible so it's more \"in control\" isn't a new one; a lot of people on the right hold it. And the idea that the left (in the voter bloc sense) likes being restricted in this way to the point where they will sometimes make obeying restrictions into a performative social signaling type of thing isn't new to them, either.\n\nA lot of these people have accurately noticed that when the government gets \"I can tell you to do this\" normalized on any particular subject, not only do you never get that particular freedom back but it also makes it easier for the next command to be considered normal. They aren't going to see \"take vaccines\" as a needle-thin targeted command, because to them it's part of a super-obvious wave of \"no, we eventually want to have much greater control over what you can be compelled to do or not do in a lot of parts of your life; do this one so the next one is easier for us, please\".\n\nThe reason this is distinct is because it deemphasizes the \"do vaccines work and do they have microchips\" part of things; you can think the vaccines are part of a greater scheme to control you without thinking they have nano-tech control devices, particularly. Imagine the scenario you proposed with the aliens to include \"and if they get everyone to have microchips, they've established a precedent where they get greater control over all human healthcare forever\" and you are close.\n\nThe Last Psychiatrist once did an article on Dove Soap creating arguments on beauty, where the practical upshot of creating the argument for Dove is that they were then viewed as an authority on beauty at least important enough to be in the argument. More simply, they normalized the idea of \"If Dove gets something wrong on beauty, that matters\" which naturally leads into \"Dove matters\". Similarly here, the right is correct to notice that if the left can force vaccines on them, then \"We are an authority on this vaccine and making you take it\" naturally translates into \"We are an authority on your health, and can make you do a bunch of stuff\".\n\nI actually think part of why \"these have microchips to control you\" theories got a foothold as easily as they did is because of this; if the political left views this not just as a \"get good health outcomes\" thing, but also as a \"how dare they disobey us; crush the other!\" thing as well, then the average person might pick up those \"this is also about making sure people know who is boss\" vibes and go looking for a plausible way the left gets the control it's clearly seeking from a simple shot. Some people look in the wrong place for the mechanism of control (the tech) but that doesn't mean the actual mechanism of control (establishing an ever widening sphere of places in which one has command) doesn't exist.",

In fact, I think it explains a lot more than people's varying reactions to COVID.  Something like 25% of Americans hate something like another 25% of Americans and think latter is out to destroy the former's way of life (and the feeling is mutual).  So, yeah, trust is going to be hard to build.  And even when the objective evidence is pretty strongly on one side, sometimes people do potentially harmful things just to spite their enemies.  In the case of COVID this is even easier to do because the risk is in this weird gray area somewhere between background-level that everyone sort of ignores and existential that scares everyone into the same boat.",

But the experts have beclowned themselves again and again throughout this pandemic\"\n\nThis whole article could have been summarized in these two sentences, and it's really all you need to know. The establishment has visibly produced a string of completely absurd measures and policies against Covid. Every time you get something like Biden ignoring mask laws, that's a hit to the credibility of vaccines and scientists. It's like OJ Simpson, who got found not guilty because he was guilty, but the police tried to frame him anyway.\n\nI think Scott managed to get this right, but he's softening it by far too much. \"People feel like the establishment is hostile aliens\" is one thing. \"The establishment acts in ways that resemble hostile aliens\" is very different. And Scott is putting too much emphasis on the former, and not enough on the latter, and when he does mention the latter, it's things that they're doing at the start of the pandemic, not things they're doing now. Biden ignored the mask laws just a month ago, and eviction bans where Covid is used as an excuse for blatantly political sticking it to the landlords are quite recent.  Scott didn't even mention the double standard over BLM riots during a pandemic.",

Clearly no. Did Democrats exercise a double standard over BLM protests? Absolutely, and I called people in my own social circles on this at the time. Do liberals favor eviction bans because they stick it to landlords? It probably increases support, although caring for poor and potentially homeless people is already left-aligned policy without bringing landlords into the picture at all.\n\nBut at the same time, when right wing establishment figures have acted to politicize questions like \"is Covid-19 dangerous and worth taking seriously at all?\" Or \"is it a good idea to get vaccinated?\" Which are much simpler and easier to answer than the ones we're looking at here, then expecting left wing figures to do a better job than they're doing to set a better example means holding them responsible for being much smarter than figures across the aisle from them.\n\nLeft wing figures could have done a much better job than they have, but if they had met these standards,  it would have meant our populace was divided along political lines into \"the dumb side that needs to be carefully shepherded\" and \"the smart side which is responsible for taking care of them.\" I don't think we can expect things to shake out like that in reality.

The places without much parasites tend to be the places where medical trials are comparatively excellent.  This association is not coincidental.\n\nThat is, a high standard of quality for evidence may bias you towards interventions that work in developed countries, and bias you away from interventions that work in developing countries, insofar as there is a difference in outcome between them.\n\nAnd I think this is a lot more of a generalized phenomenon than that statement may imply, and that a high standard of quality for evidence is itself not an accident; we calibrate to the environment we experience.\n\n(Also, the hostile alien thing is quite general, and I've slowly come to a position I'd describe as rational anti-rationality, away from a position I used to occupy in which I believed it was best to believe whatever the best arguments and evidence suggested was true.  Increasingly I believe the relevant currency is not evidence, but trust.)",

Ivermectin clearly isn't as effective as a vaccine.\n2. Several of the top studies claiming it was super-effective were obviously fraudulent (and now have been proved fraudulent).\n3. Ivermectin is almost certainly more effective than a placebo.\n4. Even if Ivermectin is basically only as effective as a placebo, it still is probably effective enough to use as a treatment of last resort.\n4A. I originally would have had a joke that some of the patients might have worms; it did not occur to me that patients actually having worms might have been a significant factor in some studies.\n5. Many of the studies saying that ivermectin doesn't work aren't actually proving that, they're only proving that it isn't 90%+ effective or that they are bad at determining study size.\n6. The Scientific Establishment has failed miserably here.  There should be at least one \"gold standard\" Western trial with at least 2500 people.\n6A. Also the political establishment has failed miserably here; why didn't Ron DeSantis and the Florida Legislature order the state medical establishment to conduct a study?\n7. Publishers such as Elsevier regularly publish crap; they publish both pro-IVM and anti-IVM crap so it is presumably incompetence.",

The US is the richest nation in the world with the preeminent medical establishment. Haiti is one of the poorest nations where medical care depends to a significant degree on the organizational efforts of one man: Dr. Paul Farmer.\n\nCovid-19 deaths per day (7 day average) in the US peaked around 3400 deaths per day. Covid deaths per day in Haiti peaked at 6.\n\n3400 divided by 6 is 567. The ratio should be 30. In fact it should be lower than 30 considering the glaring difference in resources.\n\nThere have been 751,815 deaths from Covid in the US but only 658 deaths in Haiti.\nhttps://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries\n\n1142 times as many deaths in the US!\n\nHow do we explain this? We need a list of hypotheses and widespread use of prophylactic ivermectin in Haiti is as good as any other hypothesis I have heard.\n\nA prophylactic treatment is different from a cure. Daily aspirin in small doses has been recommended to reduce thekk likelihood of heart disease. This does not mean that aspirin will cure heart disease.\n\nIvermectin may not cure Covid and yet be a prophylactic which reduces the chance of getting Covid. \n\nA COVID-19 prophylaxis? Lower incidence associated with prophylactic administration of ivermectin\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7698683/\n\nUsing the drug ivermectin for prophylactic or preventive purposes among healthcare workers with high exposure to patients with the virus reduces the risk of presenting symptomatic Covid-19 by 74% compared to their peers working under the same conditions.\nhttps://dominicantoday.com/dr/covid-19/2021/09/13/use-of-ivermectin-reduces-risk-of-covid-disease/\n\n",

The age difference especially is a strong explanation because almost all of the deaths in the US are among the elderly.",

I would expect this to take off another factor of two or so\n\nI‚Äôm not sure whether COVID is endemic in Haiti, but I would be unsurprised if it hasn‚Äôt fully reached all of Haiti yet, especially the isolated communities that are poorly connected. I would expect this to be about another factor of two. Remember that some countries (for example, Australia) have had essentially no COVID deaths) because they‚Äôve been good at isolating populations and lockdowns.\n\nThe under reporting could easily represent another factor of ten on top of those, so this would bring Haiti to a higher number of deaths per cases than the US, as expected by their worse healthcare.\n\nFrankly, the US and Haiti are extremely different countries because of economic and age situations, and you don‚Äôt need to bring in anything mysterious to explain it.",

In some ways, that's kind of the major point of this essay.\n\nWhat you're calling complication the question is exactly how good empirical science is done. Paraphrasing Feynman, who used to talk on t his, the way you do good science is you sit down and think of every possible confounding factor,  every way in which your hypothesis could  be wrong, and you try to prove each one of these.  Only if you are completely unable to prove that your hypothesis is wrong, considering every possible complicating factor, do you start to consider the possibility that it (your hypothesis) may be right.\n\nThat's clearly a very arduous way of doing things, very expensive in time and effort.  But given the human capability for fooling one's self, and seeing patterns in noise where there really are none, it's the only way we've been able to figure  out to reliably get at the truth.\n\nA point which I don't think has been emphasized enough in arguments over this is that *not* proceeding in this way has substantial risks.  People will say, well why not go with what seems/feels to be true now, and when we have time we'll work it out rigorously?  We can always change our minds...\n\nExcept that the latter is not really true.  It is very, very difficult to changes minds, once some conventional wisdom has taken hold.  Constituencies develop, economic, social and government organizations are built around them, people learn them as kids and it becomes habit and instinct -- and the result is, it's extraordinarily hard to change, and even the motivation to study whether change is a good idea drops off sharply.\n\nPresumably this is why bleeding and cupping were standards of treatment for centuries, why nobody figured out that invisible germs cause disease for centuries (and instead thought it was invisible humors), why nobody realized ulcers were caused by H. pylori and not stress for decades, why people still think eating cholesterol will give you heart disease, and so on.  In each case, it's not that these truths were hard to discover -- once you undertook to actually do so, with an open mind.  It's that the truth has to undertake a mighty struggle against embedded and accepted and plausible falsehood to even be sought, let alone be understood and accepted.\n\nWe are so much creatures of mental habit that it is exceedingly dangerous to the potential for skeptical inquiry to surrender the feeling that \"we're not sure, we don't know.\"  In principle I would say we should teach our children to cherish and preserve the feeling of \"I don't know / I'm not sure\" as long as possible, since it's cessation is usually the death of further learning.",

I don't think holding on to the thought \"I am not sure\" prevents you from forming hypotheses -- indeed, probably the contrary, no?  You only work to form ideas about what might be true if you don't think you already know.  People are most incurious when they think they already know the answer (which is part of why I think it's worth holding on to the thought that you don't.)\n\nYes, there are quite a number of First World RCTs starting up on ivermectin.  Whether that's a good idea or not I don't know.  On the one hand, all knowledge is useful.  On the other, what is *not* being done because this hypothesis is being researched?  Opportunity cost is always there.\n\nPersonally I'm dubious about ivermectin just on a priori grounds, because I don't see any good mechanisms, and I think if it were a game-changer that would've  been strongly indicated before now.\n\nSo we're looking for modest effects no matter what.  If it were up to me, I'd probably be looking for -- maybe trying to design -- small molecule inhibitors with *major* effects, much better than even the most optimistic interpretations of existing data on ivermectin could support.  that is, I'd spend less time really nailing down ivermectin and more time doing more speculative and far-ranging research work that might pay off much more.",

            "body": "Thanks, I am \"pro Ivermectin\" because I found in silico studies showing attachments to several viral proteins to be fairly compelling, and I greatly appreciate your work of having actually read all of them.\nI intrinsically tend to give pro-Ivermectin studies the benefit of doubt because nobody financially benefits from a positive finding. This is of course an implicit bias and also just my opinion. \n\nThe sidebar on worms is actually highly intriguing. \n\nMy \"vaccine distrust\" comes from several sources:\n--A Vaccine centric theory of beating Covid has a fairly hard time accounting for the fact that Africa is not on fire. Younger population, warmer climate or genetical immunities could contribute, but the counter examples of somewhat similar in these metrics Brazil or India would in part disprove this. As such, the existence of a possible Africa specific Coronavirus-like, or Covid being effectivly treated with \"non standard treatments\" would seem plausible, and Ivermectin would solve the \"Africa riddle\" while also having a mechanism of function according to multiple in Silico studies. If one believes in a possible \"Covid-Vaccinia equivalent\" to \"Covid-Variola\", then we should certainly send some crack scientists there to figure that out yes?\n--There is of course an emotional and psychological factor. I have a major in Theoretical Biophysics. Journalists and \"experts\" who are cleary not demonstrating \"subject mastery\" tell me what to do and what is science and restrict my freedoms. \n--While I am pro Vaccine, I am skeptical of m-RNA vaccines if a safe conventional vaccine like Sinovac is available and has been used 3 billion times in humans. The issue with m-RNA vaccines is that Covid can at least evade the immune system more easily, on account of m-RNA vaccines only presenting a single protein. Delta is basically 3 point mutations on the spike protein. \nSinovac would be more of a generalist, and perhaps less strong against any individual covid strain but reasonable against all of them.\n\n--A reasonable case can be made for Ivermectin in that it does no harm, and a very reasonable case if you simply see it as a mostly harmless (we know the side effects reasonably well) placebo. Giving it, under controlled conditions, safely to people who want it is imho fine. \nDeclaring reverse jihad on \"Horse dewormer guzzling rednecks\" is completely out of line. \nNothing stops you from being vaccinated and taking ivermectin. One is prevention, the other is cure. The vitriol against it is so out of line that my admittdely conspiracy spidey senses are tingling.\n\n--Concerning myocarditis from vaccinations, I am of the opinion that this is due to accidental intravenous rather then intramuscular injection (a phenomenon also known from smallpox vaccine). There are pragmatic ways to reduce the odds of this, and probably save hundreds of lives. That this is not done seriously galls me. ",

For context, I ran out and got three shots of mRNA vaccine as soon as possible. \n\nAs I understand it, the mRNA technique is getting a lot more directly involved in the body's chemical pathways than previous vaccines. Is there strong evidence and theory that this can't affect these or other pathways in unintended ways? Do we have strong evidence and theory that the reprogramming of these pathways won't have longer term effects on the immune system's reaction to the body's own markers (e.g. either making it more permissive and allowing cancer or less permissive and creating auto-immune responses) or affect gene expression (even if it doesn't affect DNA) etc. \n\nIf you google these questions, you get lots of comforting CDC/FDA pages or very dense immunology papers that seem several steps removed from these questions. But of course, public health communication has consistently been focused on convincing the public to take particular actions, so there's always that nagging question. \n\nIs this a situation where:\n1) we just have no idea\n2) these problems are ruled out essentially entirely by theory and evidence\n3) we think that these problems would have shown up if they were going to, but we can't rule out some edge cases",

So the body builds the foreign protein and that gets you your immune response.  How do you know it doesn't *continue* to build the foreign protein?  Because the pseudo-infection doesn't continue.  Also because, since you are mimicking, to a substantial extent, what a virus does naturally, there are many and powerful methods the body has for discovering and snuffing out illegal alien instructions for making protein.\n\nmRNA vaccine are *in principle* very simple technology, and the reason they are only coming into existence now should give you additional reason to be more confident in them: the problem has always been that the body is *too* good at discovering and smashing alien nucleic acids. The difficulty in getting an mRNA vaccine to work was preserving it *against* the body's detection and kill machinery long enough for it to do its work.  Tricks had be played to make it unnaturally harder to identify and destroy.  But even so, it's wiped out quickly, within minutes.  Future work may very well center on how to make it even longer-lived, how to get the body to reverse transcribe it back into the genome, et cetera, to engineer longer-lasting effects, immunological and otherwise.\n\nIt's very reasonable to be extra concerned at introducing some alien thing into the body that acts at a \"higher\" level of the command-and-control machinery.  The reassuring info is that *the body itself* \"feels\" the same way, and so our internal search-and-destroy apparatus is more powerfully attuned and faster-acting when it comes to those kinds of alien artifacts.  Doesn't mean we can't screw that up.  But we'd have to work harder, or be more (un)lucky.",

My one followup would be that we know that some real infections are cleared quickly by the body but come with long postviral syndromes (e.g. EBV) that seem to have something to do with the immune response. Is there any concern that mRNA vaccines could have similar effects? Again, is this something that is a real concern but would have been observed already, ruled out by theory or still a longshot possibility?",

The body can do weird and surprising things and the more you know about immunology the humbler you get, in my experience.\n\nBut it would be surprising, to me.  The vaccine components are eliminated pretty quickly, the mRNA within minutes to hours, and the components of the lipid nanoparticles over a week or two.   The longest-lived components are a few somewhat unnatural polymers that have to be laboriously converted in the liver to something more oxidizable, this seems to take a week or two according to rat studies.   So it's hard to think of a mechanism for long-term effects.  Why would that happen?\n\nWith the virus itself, one would assume (in the case of COVID) that long-term effects are a result of the damage that is done before the virus is cleared.  Some tissues in the body repair themselves quickly, some very slowly, and  some never repair themselves at all (which is part of why heart attacks and strokes are so deadly of course).  So it is possible the COVID infection sometimes damages tissues that heal very slowly or not at all, and this is responsible for any long-term effects.\n\nThat said, there are viral infections that \"hide out\" and can persist for decades.  The herpes family is famous for this, they become quiescent chunks of DNA/RNA living in cells peaceably, reproducing slowly and being passed on from cell to cell without causing the massive disruption and death (and aggressive immune response) of a more active infection, and so they can be there for a long time, sometimes flaring up into an aggressive  infection years to decades later.  I don't think anyone suggests COVID is like this, if only because it tends to infect fast-growing cells, like the epithelial cells that line the lungs and blood vessels, rather than long-lived nerve or immune cells.  But who knows?  There is still much to learn about this disease.",

Are you saying that post-viral syndromes aren't really best characterized as auto-immune diseases? Or alternatively that the auto-immune diseases that result from infections (I've seen this claimed for type-1 diabetes for instance) are actually either ongoing responses to latent/active infections or the result of organ damage that the acute response to those infections caused?\n\nI'm actually realizing that I don't know the answer to the basic question of: if you somehow got a type-1 diabetic's own beta cells and reimplanted them, would their immune system immediately kill them again or is that threat now gone? Given that type-1 diabetes takes years to kill off all the islet cells, should we be extracting and freezing diabetics' own islet cells for later retransplantation?",

It's indeed the case that infection can have strange and long-lasting effects on the immune system.  There are weird rare cases where you get remission of cancer after an infection (so that would be good), and of course there cancers that are *caused* by chronic infection (hepatitis and liver cancer, HPV and cervical/head/neck cancers).  With respect to diabetes, I'm not sure what the informed opinion is, e.g.:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2570378/\n\nI don't know nearly enough to have an opinion even worth writing down about the reason for most long-lasting post-infection consequences. I was just trying to list out the possibilities, because none of them are really very plausible for the vaccine, which, after it triggers and immune response, does nothing else, either chemically or biologically (so far as I know).\n\nIslet cells are transplanted as a therapy for diabetes, but so far as I know it's always from a donor (and a dead one at that), so you have to go on immunosuppressants, which is kind of harsh.  They do do autotransplants for pancreatitis (experimentally), but I don't know if anyone has ever tried to do what you're saying, which is identify a person prone to diabetes 1 and harvest islet cells for later transplantation prophylactically. I would guess the practical problem there is identifying people at sufficiently high risk for the procedure, the fact that the procedure is a surgical intervention (hence not without risk itself), and the fact that it probably costs a crap-ton of money.\n\nBut it is theoretically a very interesting question: would the immune system knock off the transplanted cells anyway?  My gut feeling is yes, it would, since as far as I know once the immune system has been sensitized to attack something, it rarely forgets -- which is why vaccines work at all, and why people don't usually get better spontaneously from autoimmune diseases.",

The average lifespan reduction type 1 diabetes is 12 years, so the surgery would have to be incredibly dangerous (which seems unlikely for something that would essentially be a biopsy for extraction) to make that outweigh the benefits. \n\nThat would seem to suggest that early harvesting of islet cells might be worthwhile assuming the immune system wouldn't immediately kill them again. \n\nThen again, perhaps you could use CRISPR to remove/change the surface proteins the immune system is targeting and then reintroduce the cells?

As someone who is 100% convinced Covid vaccines are a Bad Idea, I'd love you to give them the same treatment; my mind is open.\n\nYour alien brain implant metaphor describes my thinking perfectly (yes, it IS a reasonable way to think) ‚Äî¬†except for two things. I don't distrust science/tists, I distrust the academic establishment, the medical establishment, the political establishment, and the establishment media. It's a question not of malice, but of incentives. I'm sure I don't need to elaborate. Second, the trojan horse Covid vaccines are introducing is not technological or medical (e.g. nanobots, DNA rewriting), it's social. Hardcore imposition of vaccines are a way to suppress independence and redefine \"freedom\" into a synonym for \"security\". This is very bad for society, regardless of the science ‚Äî I just don't see any scientific reason to take the Covid vaccine either (you can mostly thank Alex Berenson for that).",

                                    "body": "Well I think he's arguing that public health has *historically*  been the one area of government where people have tolerated a surprising (by modern standards) level of enforcement rigor, and a surprisingly low (by moderns standards) -- like zero -- level of dissidence.\n\nAnd I think that is quite true.  Remnants of it persist even today: if you refuse to take your TB meds, almost all states IIRC have provisions in public statute for having you locked up until you do.  No trial needed, no charge, no civil liberties defense -- if the local public health authority says you've got TB and aren't cooperating in treatment, you go off to jail indefinitely.  I think most modern people would find that a little shocking, but it's a leftover from an earlier time period when people were just a lot less tolerant of dissent when it came to infectious disease.\n\nThere are similar provisions for STDs, in many cases a treating physician is compelleted to report them, and public health authorities are entitled to do tracing, none of it with the patient's consent.  Imagine proposing *that* as a new law in today's world.\n\nIn some ways I feel like the Overton window on public health just slowly shifted over the past few decades, without people much noticing, because infectious disease just went out of the life experience of most younger people.\n\nOne reason I say this is because in my experience a lot of older people are just kind of baffled over some of the heat on vaccines.  When I was a kid, it was absolutely routine, for example, for countries to require vaccination proof for entry.  I used to have a little yellow International Vaccine Record that my mother had to take with her when we traveled, and show to border officers.  In some cases we had to get extra shots to visit some country or other.  Totally routine, unremarkable.\n\nSame with school vaccines.  It was routine to require these things, and nobody in my experience much thought  twice about it.  We didn't even *ask* whether they were super duper effective or just kind of, or whether there might be some reason rooted in civil liberties or religion or whatever to carve out some exceptions.  It's just what people routinely did, and getting passionate about it seems like getting passionate about the requirement that  you have a driver's license before you drive on public roads.  Sure, if you think about it, I can readily see the case for why this might be an infringement of civil liberties in some sense or other, but it feels strange to even get worked up about it because we're so used to it.\n\nThat seems to have changed, and it's a little mystifying to me.  My tentative hypothesis is that 50 years ago we (as a people) were *much* more used to infectious disease causing serious death and destruction.  People remembered polio, and smallpox.  VD was harder to treat.  So there was a sense that this shit is verious serious and hard to deal with, so yeah we're not going to be too careful about the rights of minorities and civil disobedience when we draw these lines.\n\nThat doesn't mean it was necessarily *wrong* for times to change, of course.  Maybe we *can* afford to be more sensitive to individual liberties now, because we *have* almost entirely removed the threat of infectious disease in modern First World life.  That would probably be a good thing.  ",

Keeping out people with disease is absolutely the host country's right!\n\nI was vaguely approving of Trump doing border controls [1] to keep out people coming from abroad unless they could prove they didn't have covid, and he was getting heat from the left for doing it, because The Science says border controls don't work[2].\n\nI expect the polarity on border controls for disease have flipped completely.

I wouldn't say Supreme Court jurisprudence has moved in that direction, more the reverse actually -- they have recognized an unprecedented right to gay marriage, there is the famous Roe v. Wade, they have somewhat expanded Second Amendment rights (lately), and generally been pretty harsh on First Amendment infringements.  And while Gideon v. Wainright and Miranda v. Arizona -- which *really* made a difference -- are a bit outside  the 50 year window, they're pretty close to it.\n\nIf you mean that as a society we have become much less tolerant of each other, more inclined to self-balkanize into tribes inside of which relatively little dissent is tolerated, I would regretfully agree with that.",

I view vaccines, like I view airbags, helmets when skiing, or the decision to smoke, as opportunities for natural selection.  They are ways in which the future can have a higher fraction of more prudent and thoughtful human beings.   I'm reluctant to have government impose good ideas on people against their will, because I would rather people who have bad ideas experience the full consequences of those.  They will either learn something useful in the School o' Hard Knocks, or as I said reduce the burden of their genotype on the future.\n\nThat said, I also believe people have a right of free association, so if for example a company wants to say \"sorry, no vaccine no job\" that should be respected also, as an extension of the right of the individual to say \"sorry, I'm not convinced by your fancy-dancy vaccination bullshit, not doing it.\"   That is, I don't like government telling individuals they have to be vaccinated, and I also don't like government telling individuals, or voluntary groups of individuals, that they can't insist on vaccination for membership or private association.\n\nIt's gets a little tricky when we get down to the weeds, of what we do with children in required public school setting.  So there would  need to be some negotiation and compromise there, unfortunately, as the simple solution isn't viable.",

A large proportion of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. For those people, giving up their job on short notice, without another one lined up, is a sacrifice of greater scope than most people are willing to make for any political principles.",

It reaches a qualitatively different level of coerciveness, much closer to the \"do this or we put you in jail\" basic definition of \"force.\"\n\nThe second paragraph is just a restatement of your thesis, which I totally understand but alas totally reject.  If you're *not* willing to give up your employment (except in the case where  it is literally impossible to get another job, as would happen with a general goverment mandate) then my judgment is your ethical principles just aren't very strong.\n\nLook, people are histoically willing to risk *death* for the highest ethical principles, right? That's what it means to join the Marines to defend liberty and the flag, or become a cop and risk death to enforce social order, or even become a fireman and rush into burning houses to save people.

We feel like it's a big, big sacrifice to lose a job, have to move back in with Mom or go on welfare for 6 months while you find another.  It's really not.  It's nothing like wading ashore at Omaha Beach or Iwo Jima, not in the same universality class as \"give me liberty or give me death\" or picking up your musket and walking towards the sound of gunfire at Gettysburg.",

I've been responsible in the past, for a succession of months, for keeping a friend afloat who was desperately looking for a job, and only had me between her and living in a homeless shelter. She didn't have the option of moving back in with her parents, or with me (I was living in a rental arrangement with an agreement which wouldn't allow it.) \n\nI think this bit from a comment on the SSC subreddit is pretty illustrative, and keep in mind that this is describing a level of poverty a step *above* homelessness.\n\n>I tend to think the \"housing or mental health\" thing is badly framed. You're not going to have good mental health without housing. I didn't have good mental health even when I did, in part because my other immediate material needs were uncertain and under pressure. The specific story that I always, always remember is breaking down in my local Target over whether or not I could afford a tomato. I just wanted to make something nice that I thought might bring me a tiny bit of joy, and I couldn't even do that.\n\n>To zoom out a little, I think that once poverty reaches the level of making your immediate needs (food, housing, physical safety, etc) uncertain or threatened that it hits a bit of a step function in how stressful it is. It stops being something you can stop thinking about, which means the daily load of stress becomes much harder to escape long enough to catch your breath. It also means the good days don't have much substrate on which to work - returning to the tomato thing from a moment ago, cooking is a big self-care thing to me that became unavailable even on a good day.\"\n\nAs far as whether you could \"just go on welfare,\" in some cases that's an option, but many states deliberately make the process difficult. My friend in question lives in Kentucky, and researched her options, but was told that the whole process of getting an application approved could take upwards of a year.\n\nI know I'm just a single data point here, but I've thought about this quite a few times, and have acquaintances and relatives giving examples of experiences of both to build on, but personally, I would not only sooner risk my life in the military in an active war zone (and in my twenties, considered doing so, simply as a job, not for any higher principles,) but would choose to *actually* die in battle over the prospect of a long-term homeless lifestyle.

I grew up firmly lower middle class, and for a time my family even survived on food stamps.  I got my school lunch for free for several years, thanks to Federal antipovery initiatives in the 70s.  I never had new clothes until high school, I always wore hand-me-downs from better off cousins, which my mother would take in.\n\nI did better myself, because I worked like a dog all through school and made damn sure I got top marks.  My family encouraged me to think that education was the ticket (and I think, in that era, they were right).   There were times I was relatively poor myself -- when I was in graduate school, for example, I used to buy one chicken a week, and stretch it out for 7 days with rice and veggies.  Once I miscalculated how long I could stiff the electric company and they turned the power off, which is a giant pain because then they want a deposit to turn it back on.  I wrote letters because the phone was too expensive (no Internet in those days), and I rode my bike everywhere because gasoline = $$.  I did  all the work on my car myself, of course, and it was 15 years old and I bought it used.   But I was poor by choice, because I was going to school and did not want work to take away from the time I could devote to study. I fully intended to be at the top of my class, and I was pretty darn close.\n\nSo yeah I do know what it's like to be poor.  In fact, I'd say that's one reason I'm not overwhelmed with the proposition you're stating.  I'm not *afraid* of being poor. I really don't like it, don't get me wrong, but I know I can survive it, and escape it.  I had to work crappy jobs once or twice for bosses who didn't like me, so I had to keep my mouth shut and my  head down, and I've been fired from jobs and had to flop around a bit to find a new one.  It's definitely not something I want to do, but it doesn't scare me.  That's one reason I'm not super impressed by someone saying the limit of their commitment to some great big ethical value is...up until I have to quit my job and find another.  I get that it would be a drag, sure.  But nope, it's just not up there with the things other people have sacrificed for their values.",

I can well understand that some people might not want their income to depend on supplying sex (to people they don't like), and my advice in that situation would be: then don't.  Make sure you don't get addicted to drugs, stay the fuck in school and get good grades, use rubbers every time, get a job as soon as you legally can and never ever fail to save something each week, so you have options if shit happens.  Pretty basic adulting stuff, it seems to me.  If you're not quite right in the head, or exceedingly unlucky it may not work out anyway, and that's why I give a little to the Salvation Army at Christmas.",

It sounds much cheaper to me than designing a new drug. And this is one of the few aspects that just does not add up.\n\nAnother is why it is banned in a lot of countries. If this ban makes sense to you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gndsUjgPYo then surely your brain works differently (probably much better) than mine.\n\nI think ivermectin believers say that it has to be taken at a very early stage, or before the infection happens for it to be effective. If a PC country wanted to do a study they would need to include this in their parameters.\n\nI do not know whether Ivermectin is useful against COVID but because its side effects are known I would definitely be happy to have some in my medicine cabinet. I have taken a non-PC jab (non mrna, I'd stay away from those), but still if I feel like symptoms are coming I'd definitely try Ivermectin, because what can I lose. Because it is banned, I have no chance to do that.\n\nWhoever used the \"my body my choice\" slogan to support any political agenda before, if that person is not angry now about the COVID situation (and motorcycle helmets), then that person is two-faced, to say the least.\n",

I hope this is a correct rephrasing of what we are saying. I.e. it is not medicine, not common sense that made this decision, but economics. So let us see the economics.\n\n> why doesn't the majority allocate $150 million of its own money (via taxes or whatever) to do a study which only a minority finds important\n\nI am sure Pfizer alone has made a profit that is magnitudes higher than $150 million. I am also sure that if in the beginning people had been asked: do you want to spend $150 million, less than 50 cents per capita in the US, if you add the EU it becomes like 20 cents for a pill that has been in use for decades, or do you want to have a competition among private companies that will pocket profit which is magnitudes higher (for each successful company), well I doubt that the majority would have decided to go with the version that is majority opinion today. \n\nI'd like to add that the opinion of the majority did not become such because of luck or facts or anything cheap. There is a lot of marketing work, i.e. time, effort and money invested done by politicians and businesses that in the end made the vaccine the choice of the majority. Significant part of this effort and time and money was invested before the vaccine was available. Just that effort was IMO magnitudes higher than doing the study.\n\nOn top of this practically all western countries banned ivermectin. This is a step further, much further. This way the profit becomes guaranteed, the investment risk for the private companies becomes negligible. Even if the outcome of this article was that ivermectin is superior to the vaccines, nothing would change, because the whole thing is decided based on economics, not medicine.\n\nAnd again another angle, $150 million is nothing compared to the big political plans that Biden is proposing ATM.\n\n> Hopefully as soon as you frame the question properly the answer jumps out at you.\n\nYes it does. From the beginning this was an economical decision, or if the decision involved something else as well, it was surely not medicine. There was doubt in the effectiveness of the vaccine, and there was doubt at the effectiveness of ivermectin. Investigating ivermectin is cheap, but it promises no proper profit, no proper GDP increase. All bet went to the vaccines so, funnily because economically that costs more money, i.e. businesses were happier to invest and work on vaccines than anything else. The people involved, politicians and science, still make all effort that the vaccine economy keeps working. I hope we agree on this, this does not contradict your answer, or if it does please let me know how.\n",

Freaking everything is an economic decision, unless you're Jeff Bezos and you have essentially infinite money and can do whatever the hell you want for the purest of ethical/aesthetic/philosophical motives.\n\nWhat difference does it make that Pfizer has $150 million they could spend on this?  Why should  they?  It almost sounds like you're saying the money should come from whoever has it, and not from  whoever wants the information.  By me that's immoral.  If you want it, pay for it.  I don't steal gasoline from my neighbor's car because he earns twice what I do and won't notice the hit that much, I go out and buy it myself, because I'm the guy who wants it, and it's right that I pay for what I want.  Wanting other people pay for what you want is the philosophy of the criminal.\n\nSure, the proposition could have been put to the American people in April of 2020: do you want to spend umpty $billions of your tax money on accelerating vaccine development (and giving Moderna, for example, the most incredible $$$ windfall ever in the history of pharma), or do you want to spend it on studying about a hundred random existing cheap pharmaceuticals to see if by random chance one of them works as well as a vaccine?\n\nAnd who knows what they would have said?  But the proposition wasn't made, the Trump  Administration just decided they knew what was the best plan, and they went with Option A.  May not have been exactly what *I* would have done, but it was squarely within their ambit and mandate.  That's what we elect Presidents to do, make tough choices in tricky situations.  If you ended up not liking the choice, well then presumably you voted to boot Trump from office in November and prefer the Biden Administration approach, whatever it is.  Democracy in action!",

            "body": "Solid work.  Very well done!  Congratulations.\n\nA few critiques for your consideration:\n\n1. Given who you are, I'm surprised by the absence of a Bayesian analysis, and more than almost any other factor than tribalism (vide infra), this seems relevant to how people made up their minds in this case:\n\n1a) How often do studies from Argentina or Bangladesh end up violently overturning medical consensus opinion in the US or Europe, meaning amazing  things are discovered in Sao Paolo that were totally overlooked in London or Seattle?\n\n1b) How often do vaccines succeed in almost entirely preventing a viral disease (or its evil consequences)?  How often do they have strange awful side-effects not detected in the initial approval studies?\n\n1c) How often do repurposed antibiotics, or indeed any small molecule drug, end up being powerful cures for viral disease?\n\n1d) How often are public health policy people dead wrong?\n\n1e) Notwithstanding (1d), how often are public health policy people *initially* wrong (when a problem first appears), and how often are they unrealistically overzealous all the time?\n\n1f) How often in a person's personal experience have they been told something confidently by a soi-disant smart/educated/credentialed person that turned out to be wrong?  How likely is it that people in general overestimate (if not outright misrepresent) their own competence in areas not exactly within their training and experience?\n\n1g) How often do politicians in search of votes and pundits in search of page clicks oversimplify or overdramatize if not caricature the stakes in a debate, the importance of the favored outcome, or the villainy/ignorance of the supporters of the disfavored outcome?\n\n2. When you discuss the tribal aspects of this, you seem to assume that members of each tribe arrive at their conclusions completely independently, and ask \"What common experience could lead all these people to *independently* arrive at Conclusion X?\"  But this overlooks the very nature of tribalism (or indeed of social movements, fads, bubbles, et cetera) in that for a large number of members of a tribe, the reason to have Conclusion X is merely because it's a dogma of the tribe.\n\nConsider the thought experiment: if nuclear power plants had been invented by a bunch of bearded hippies funded by Greenpeace in the 2010s as a solution to global warming, instead of by a bunch of pocket-protector-wearing narrow-necktie poindexters in the 1940s funded by the military to build awesome weapons of destruction, would you not see a neck-snappingly abrupt reversal of positions pro- and anti- among a very substantial number of people?\n\nHuman beings are perfectly capable of believing, or at least subscribing to belief in, propositions that go strongly *against* their own inclinations, or available evidence, if it promotes their social belonging in the right way.  I'm a little sorry you didn't tackle this issue.  It's certainly discouraging, in one sense, because it says *no* amount of improved access to information, education, less screwups by the expert class, et cetera -- *no* difference in what is available to the individual thinking it over -- will reduce tribalistic splits on issues, because these do not arise in the first place from distinctions in individual awareness.  They arise from the requirement of any faith group to have a dogma, and to insist on faith in the dogma as a condition of membership.\n\n3. Along these lines: your final prescription (\"How can we get more people to trust (but verify) the experts I trust (but verify)?\") reads a little tribalistic itself.  Have you considered the possibility that nothing is actually going wrong here?  Science and expert opinion is being severely challenged -- is that a *bad* thing, generally speaking?  Maybe not!  It's not like your (and my) preferred worldview here (\"vaccines work well, you should all take one, you can take/not take ivermectin if you get sick, according to your personal beliefs, but you should be reluctant to become a zealot about  that and try to persuade others to do so\") isn't dominant.  It is.  Most people get vaccinated.  Most people don't become ivermectin crusaders.  A few people fall into the other categories in both cases, and it causes strife and dissension, and the majority is compelled to accommodate this to some extent or other: compromises have to be made in legislation and regulation and decree, room must be made for disagreement that the majority finds futile or stupid.\n\nIs that a *bad* thing?  Maybe that's actually how a republic should work.  Maybe the fact that a minority that feels strongly about something that the majority finds ridiculous *should* be allowed to carve out a certain amount of space for its beliefs, and should be able to disrupt the ability of the majority to get its way, a bit.  Even if it costs lives?  Yeah maybe.  It's probably more important in the long run that the everyone remains mutually committed to the republic and solving problems  by voting and argument (rather than weapons and death)  than that every life that can be saved is.",

If you know the person is in the USA, you are down to 28 bits.  If you know their gender, there goes another one.  If you know there state, there goes a couple more.  Approximate age, a few more still.\n\nOnce information is released, it can never be un-released, but it can be combined with other information.\n\nIt can be surprising what has been shown to uniquely identify people.  A few links from a social relationship graph -- not the actual names, but just the shape of the graph in your immediate neighborhood[1], your home and work location[2], of course your browser's device fingerprint[3], or your writing or coding style[4].\n\n\nLikeliness to happen:\n\nAs just one example, internet advertisers in the sketchier/less-ethical parts of the adtech universe have large monetary incentives to reidentify users, using whatever data they can get their hands on, and though they are unlikely to make public statements about their efforts, their capability has been repeatedly demonstrated.[5]\n\n\nWhether privacy harms are outweighed by society's interest in learning true and important facts about the world using the scientific method:\n\nMan, I have no idea.

            "body": "I disagree with the sociological takeaway, and probably a few other takeaways as well. You seem to be suggesting that we should have had an answer for whether ivermectin was effective before we had an answer. Why? Because this had become a red/blue tribe issue? Because you couldn't talk about it on social media so we should circle the wagons and say those people were eventually justified? Because we should have a way to decide based on incomplete data, or based on an incomplete understanding of confounding factors? I don't see it that way at all.\n\nThe problem, as I see it, was that there was credible evidence that something was going on here, but also serious reason for doubts. Some smart people were saying exactly that, and not challenging individual decision-making based on the available data. They said, \"Sure, there may be something there, but it's not clear yet whether it's a good treatment, for whom, or under what treatment circumstances\" (early/late, treatment/prophylaxis, genetic profiles, other proposed subgroups). That was a reasonable set of conclusions to come away with from the data available.\n\nScott's discussion of \"how should we have been treating this all along\" misses the point. Crafting heuristics that lend more certainty than the data support is just plain bad practice.\n\nMore generally, there was the community touting ivermectin as a great replacement for vaccination, and the reactionary community that condemned ivermectin as an evil distraction. Okay, but that's just people whose heuristics led them to greater certainty than the data supported. If there's anything to learn from them, it's that we should be aware how others' bad heuristics - and fighting over bad heuristics - can lead us toward greater certainty than we should have.\n\nThe real takeaway should have been something like, \"Let's not settle for a simple yes/no answer to this question. Instead, let's call this an open question and look into it more seriously.\"\n\nThis is what we do in less politically charged areas. We keep looking until some intrepid researcher does an interesting subgroup analysis that generates a hypothesis. That hypothesis is tested and (unlike the dozens of other hypotheses we end up rejecting) we discover some confounding factor we hadn't considered before.\n\nIn this case, I think you've buried the lead on ivermectin. The lead should be, \"Ivermectin may be a lifesaving treatment for COVID-19 sufferers with parasitic worm infections.\" It looks like that's a promising subgroup explanation of whom this drug works for. This feels like an excellent opportunity to promote de-worming efforts around the globe and save lives. Too bad it got politicized as a binary \"cure/hoax\" before we could figure out the real answer to the question.",

            "body": "> am I secretly suggesting that we make rationality higher status?\nI'm all for it, but asking society to become rational enough to make a dent in the problem seems infeasible. Between \"believe X\" and \"become significantly more rational\", there must be some message/framing that would improve this whole situation.\n\n\nAnd I think Scott identified likely the best take:\n> we have to make the scientific establishment feel less like an enclave of hostile aliens to half the population... But I don‚Äôt really know how to do that, and any speculation would be too political even for a section titled ‚ÄúThe Political Takeaway‚Äù.\n\n\nBut I'm happy to speculate!\n\n\n1) We just have to engage with people. The overall conclusion of Lee McIntyre analysis in \"How to Talk to a Science Denier\" felt viscerally right to me: science deniers can be convinced if they can just talk openly, candidly, *safely* with more rational people. \"Safe spaces\" are a wonderful idea Our schools, universities and institutions purport to have safe spaces, but they aren't safe for the people that likely need them most: the half of our population that is not liberally aligned.\n\n\n2) In absence of those healthy, personal relationships, people will turn to whatever authority is most prominent in their lives. And we have horrible, evil, awful people in positions of authority. I don't actually know how, but the required outcome is obvious: get money out of politics, and invest in public media.",

Why is a prophet ever without honor in his own country?\n\nBecause for most people most of the time, the fastest and surest way to wind up dead or seriously disadvantaged has been at the hands of our fellow humans. At the same time, \"our group\", whether by faith, family, tribe, regiment, frat, whatever, are the people we can surely trust to have our back when we need support, when we are sick or threatened.\n\nTherefore, whatever else happens, whatever we have to do, believe absurdities, participate in degrading rituals, risk our lives, blindly follow barking insane leaders, parrot obvious lies to our detriment, do or suffer terrible things, but please whatever you do, please don't kick us out of the group!\n\nAs a result, when people are presented with evidence, strong evidence, irrefutable evidence, evidence verging on philosophical proof, that their deeply held beliefs, the beliefs that people use to define themselves and tribe, are wrong, that the tribal leaders are crazy, stupid or malevolent, that we are headed to catastrophe - rather than change beliefs, change leaders, change tribe or change course, most people, most of the time will instead double down. Witness the behavior of cultists. Solzhenitsyn has documented true believer Communists heartfully confessing their guilt at a show trial because the Party demanded it.\nThe process is called \"cognitive dissonance\" and it is abundantly documented. As alluded to earlier, there are entire religions organized around the principle.\n\nCognitive dissonance is not limited to stupid people. In fact, the intelligent are at least as prone, perhaps because they are better at rationalizing. In fact, much so-called \"knowledge work\" is basically manipulating symbols in order to justify whatever the paymaster wants to see justified.",

The roundworm incidence was an eye-opener, though.\n\nWhen you mention myocarditis, though, it seems you pooh-pooh it just a little bit.  The thing is though is that the incidence in young males has really surprised the CDC and caught it a bit off-guard.  The whole of the vaccine safety meetings are available published at \n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/live-mtg-2021-08-30.html\n\nAnd in particular CDC showed how far actual cases of myocarditis exceeded their prior estimates in the slide in the YT video linked below.  Their estimates were for single-digit numbers but instead they found real-world incidences in the hundreds.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/mfFeocgSKvU?t=204\n",

Subsequent safety meetings show similarly high rates vs. expectations - not that they're \"high\" in a global sense, just  high compared to the rainbow estimates they'd put out earlier.  \n\nThe good news is that this does seem mainly transient in nature.  The bulk (some 80%) end up hospitalized, but it's short duration and so far, the CDC tracking indicates that by 3 months, over 70% are fully Sx-free and cleared for all activities by their cardiologists.  (3 months is all the tracking data they have so far as of last month's meeting)\n\nJust a heads-up on this issue, you'll see people citing the 5-year mortality rate for **chronic** myocarditis as if it applies to these more transient cases, when pretty clearly it should not be relevant.",

I don't think my position on taking vitamins is in any way unreasonable and would be unlikely to stop unless somebody made a strong argument that they were actually harmful.\n\nWith that in mind it feels like the wrath and ridicule towards Ivermectin must come from the (admittedly often accurate) conflation between Ivermectin and Antivaxxing, and the vitriol used to attack my above position is just ludicrous and takes away any credibility the speaker could have.

Talking like an individual person is clearly either sick or not sick. When you got these mathematical models and whatnot, though, a person can have a relatively greater or lesser probability of getting sick or not getting sick based on some or other variables. \n\nYou and me, we're walking around, according to the modelling on which the public policy is being based we are all in a superposition of sick and not sick, on a probability distribution, right? But obviously a person is still either sick or they are not sick. The probability distribution is collapsed into one or the other state. \n\nWhere do people fall on this issue? It's a complicated one, and not distinct from ethics; I recommend reading the play by Michael Frayne. ",

Many technically-minded people have reticence, some (crackpotish, or among the small scientific red-tribe - it's becoming difficult to distinguish between those) health-related scientist are even among the not-so-warm to vaccine crowd. \nI think people could trust a utterly alien circle, provided this circle has no past hostility (and preferably some past helpful behavior) to show, so the political aspect (the advice-givers are actually hostile, at least on other subjects) is more than enough for explanation. Add the fact that Covid is not Ebola (if it was, there would be far less space for discussion and far more for riots around pharmacies holding the rationed vaccine), and that's more than enough. \n\nThe political aspect in particular is huge: In an increasingly polarized political climate, 95% of biological professors are democrat! I guess it would be enough even if covid was worse. Maybe not Ebola-like, but significantly worse.\n\nThis 95% is completely crazy, and I can guess something about the remaining 5%: They follow Greg Cochran. They have stumbled by accident or interest on parts of biology that is taboo to the blue tribe, and, because of polarization, now tends to reject other parts they would never have rejected 50 years ago. \nMost parts of my life are linked to techno-science (work, practical hobbies, learning interests), since as long as I remember. But the evolution of science, at least those last ten years, in its public message form, makes me sad. Not to the point of wholly rejecting it, it's still my main interest in life....But now I zap out mainstream media except for mindless entertainment, and get anything I consider seriously from other sources, like this blog.

Also, Scott, a million thanks for finally doing a deep dive on ivermectin.\n\nIf there's one thing to be huffish over, it's the tirade against the vaccine hesitant at the end. I swear that my following negative comments will last no more than 4 sentences, and will then return to adulatory effusiveness, but: Ahem - O Thou Who Art Vaxxed - dost thou know what it is to be threatened with termination from thy job because thou dost not wish to take an experimental drug that hath only been around 1 year? I mean, seriously - some of us are being persecuted because we want to wait 2-3 more years to see what the data is on long-term side effects. This sort of hesitancy about drugs is pretty common and is prima facia reasonable. It's not even political, or not obviously so, since (if I can cite findings from a few studies that may or may not be RCTs and may or may not be fraudulent and may or may not be significant and may or may not have confounders, because really we need Scott to figure that out) the vaccine hesitant tend to be people with PhDs and middle-aged women who vote liberal.\n\nThat having been said, it helps to have the ivermectin side of things cleared up. And this is the most brilliant thing I've read since the analysis of trapped priors, or of race and police shootings, or the other cool things that Scott comes out with so often that I can't keep track. It really deworms the horse. I mean, it hits the worm on the head. It cuts the Gordian Worm. And now I have to go re-evaluate my supply of ivermectin.",

I mean, the updated article doesn't actually give the raw numbers or a nice chart like the first version had, but here's what it says:\n\n\"The association between hesitancy and education level followed a U-shaped curve with the lowest hesitancy among those with a master‚Äôs degree, followed by those with a 4 year college degree, then a professional degree, and a doctorate. The highest hesitancy was among those with ‚â§high school education or some college.\" \n\nSo basically, the <1% change in responses, after the helicopters were weeded out, resulted in the PhD side of the U-curve dropping slightly lower than the high-school-only side. \n\nIn the meantime: apache helicopters!

Of all the people I know personally who are vax hesitant, a handful are PhDs and the rest are either current PhD students (which I guess would almost be the same), or they're at the other end of the U-curve as current undergrads (not much above high school). Most of the people I know who have bachelor or masters degrees and now work in industry are unhesitatingly vaxxed.",

The problem would affect all the data, not just the PhDs (e.g., the apache helicopters said 42% of the time they were Hispanic, which either means that real Hispanic respondents were more likely to have that particular funny bone, or that the jokesters were more likely to lie about race than about education level or age).

In ML, we have specific model building techniques, usually called Fraud Detection, to build models that will pull out the signal from this hugely lopsided categorical data. Plus you need A LOT of data.\n\nFurthermore, I think it's plausible to put Ivermectin, or any other drug that works \"non-intuitively\" into a category that only works for a segment of the total population (e.g. let's say the 20% of people who are strongly deficient in vitamin D at time of infection). In statistical terms, an \"interaction effect\" which can be tough to capture and easy to confound. Overall this is going to be very difficult to tease out from the noise of SES, geographic happenstance and strain potency.\n\nIf we had a medical tricorder from the future, is it possible that would identify 1% of the population as strongly benefiting from administering ivermectin on infection / taking it continuously as prophylactic, where P(survive) could be increased by an order of magnitude?",

            "body": "I remember very clearly when this jamoke started their page for hydroxychloroquine (c19study.com) early in the hype cycle, before diversifying into every brand of snake oil under the sun, there were only two decently sized RCTs. They disallowed one early-treatment RCT because took place in a hospital and was therefore not \"early\" (obviously like half of the crappy convenience samples included in their \"early treatment\" list were also hospitals) and the prophylactic RCT (Boulware) got a full page treatment of \"reanalysis\" and mutually contradictory nitpicking (compliance was low! but also the placebo might have been active!) which was not afforded any of the insanely sloppy papers that French guy was churning out. I note that the current iteration of the page does not have Boulware anymore but does have multiple \"reanalyses\" of their data. Rigor is worthless if its reserved only for studies you don't like. \n\nWhat gets me about all this is that we already DID the whole \"analyze all these cheap off-patent drugs for efficacy against coronavirus\" and got a hit: dexamethasone! Studies were done, they looked promising, and it was uncontroversially accepted. It's weird, and I've found it best to think of everyone who hung on to HCQ throughout all of 2020 and to IVM all of 2021 as a very unfortunate flavor of hipster. Sure, we found a cheap drug that helped, but it wasn't THEIR cheap drug, it's the ESTABLISHMENT'S cheap drug, so piss on it.",

Right wing solutions are completely safe and risk free, and reasonably could work, but the leftists just demonize us and demand that we ignore all the cheap and safe solutions and tunnel vision in on dangerous expensive solutions.\n\nI don't have a high degree of confidence that ivermectin solves covid. I do have very high confidence, that if we held the top hundred promising treatments with completely solid safety records to the exact same standards as pfizer gets when considering their new drug, covid would be over by now.\n\nFinally, as a young person who already caught covid and has natural immunity, I see the left in extremely uncharitable light when they try to force the vaccine on me.

The Orthodox priest example below is a little better, though it misses the hostility. (Also, I once again have to commend you Scott on your consistent attempts to try and strongman opposing views that you find stupid - the world would be so much better if more people could do that). \n\nsome other data points:\n- There are medical/scientific folks in my community, and while they have a more nuanced view, even they are skeptical/untrusting.  Probably doesn't help that they've being closeted for years in a field listening to open conversations about how stupid/awful/deplorable they are.\n- Being seriously religious already means you've shown willingness to abandon the expert consensus (at least if you live in any metro area).  So my community probably has a higher-than-normal representation of the kind of people who are willing to take unconventional positions.  \n\nSo, it's kind of a situation of trapped priors as you've discussed elsewhere.  Which is actually a decent model, because I can get people to update a little, though rarely enough. The traction I make with people when arguing for the vaccines is not with expert sources but generally with updates based on data we all see - who in the community has serious COVID vs vax side effects, whether vax or not are transmitting, and what some of our community who work in the ER see.  FWIW, from ONLY this data, the model is that vax side effects are worse and under-reported (because most docs blow off reports and say the effects are just coincidence, even when serious), but I can get folks to agree that they are not THAT much worse. Maybe 50% underreported for serious effects beyond the expected out for 1-2 days. With this view of the data, folks generally agree that vax makes you 2-3x less likely to die or be hospitalized, and so they generally view it's ok for older folks or those w co-morbidities. However, the community would also say that vax is not much better with infection prevention. This is possibly biased by louder reports of breakthroughs within the community, but then again, community is only probably 25% vaxxed, and we hear about a LOT of breakthroughs. So this updated model, even with the trapped priors, isn't THAT far off of scientific consensus in microchip-land, though definitely still less confident than expert consensus.  \n\nThe other thing that I think would allow updates out of the trapped prior is seeing approved/official sources expose more questions and data counter to the political narrative, even if they're eventually proven false.  We can all see that it has been something that only deplorable people question for a while, so of course very few scientists want that risk.  I've seen a a few small instances of contrary opinions making their way out, and so have updated the priors in my argument a small amount, but I would still like to get to the point where it feels like a scientist isn't risking their career to publish any counter-narrative studies before folks in our community will remove the penalty. \n \nObviously, the best approach is your recommendation for the expert class to abandon the conflict theory model to anyone below them and get out of the bubble. But since an alien invasion feels more likely, a slight update in messaging might help.  For perspective, the meme that worked the best with me was one Zvi was using pre-mandate re vax hesitant, ie. \"go ahead and die - what do I care?\". I found this most persuasive because 1) it fits my model that everyone hates our community, 2) it fits my model of you all being mostly libertarian leaning, and 3) it fits the medical data better - ie vax are far better at preventing death than transmission. (I also originally found the \"in service of the common good\" meme persuasive in my community as well as it fits the religion, until it became clear the vaccine was non-sterlizing.) The mandate and its messaging was far more confusing ('you need to vaccinate to protect the vaccinated\"), not to mention a naked exercise in political scapegoating.   \n\nSo, do we have at least a somewhat happy ending, where I've been able to slowly pull a few people over each month to the idea of vaccinating? LOL, no - thanks Joe Biden. And I can't emphasize enough how harmful the mandates have been here, when I had been making progress. It's not just the psychological reactance that should have been wholly expected by so-called experts. For me, it's one thing for me to be a 'diplomat' of sorts with the aliens, and represent their point of view to the skeptical, while the aliens are peacefully contained in Australia. It's wholly different when the aliens attack - arguing their point of view on my part becomes a lack of solidarity, akin to treason. Thanks, JB! Really doesn't seem like the right policy if you're interested in public health. Though that was probably never the point - I suspect it was viewed as a political win-win. Scapegoat the unvaxxed if COVID resurges this winter, or if not, declare victory through strong leadership. Not like anything ever goes wrong when a political leader scapegoats a community! ;-)   \n\nP.S.: I also think a blind spot in the ACT/LW/rationalist community comes from your relative willingness to self-medicate, i.e, via nootropics. This makes you particularly willing to medicate even when you're healthy (ie. vaccinate).  A lot of folks (not just my community) don't like to medicate unless absolutely necessary, which is why I think you see IVM and the new Merck/Pfizer pills getting more traction vs vaccines. ",

When they did that, they shot their credibility in the head for vast swaths of the country: if doctors and scientists are going to put their politics above my literal life, why should I trust anything they have to say?",

No, but their statements on the matter were tepid at best and often had to be dragged out of them like pulling teeth:\n\nhttps://www.fox5ny.com/news/i-dont-judge-one-crowd-vs-another-fauci-clashes-with-gop-lawmaker-over-protests-during-coronavirus\n\nAnd note that Fauci didn't condemn BLM by name or even refer to them specifically in any way, just lamely said \"yeah, the virus could spread in a crowd, I guess you shouldn't go out.\" If you're looking for medical professionals actually opposing these specific protests, well, they're few and far between. I'm not surprised, of course -- opposing BLM last summer risked your employment and, often, your physical safety.\n\nUltimately, the message that went out was: supporting this hard-left and often violent political cause is more important to doctors and scientists than reducing Covid infections. And it shouldn't be surprising how many people checked out on their trust in the whole public health establishment once that happened. It was probably one of the Establishment's stupidest moves of the entire pandemic, though to be fair there's a lot of competition.",

            "body": "Thanks for this and it definitely put forward an idea which none of the proponents of either position are saying in terms of worms and other parasitic issues in developing nations leading to immune system suppression.\n\nMy conclusions from your conclusions:\n1. We should immediately give out ivermectin very widely in all places which have parasite issues which appears to be the vast majority of humanity.  Their immune systems are suppressed by parasites and we have a great tool to fix that and boost their immunity which  helps them in multiple ways including with covid.\n\nThis is a great solution, viable, easy, and cheap for poor countries who can't beat rich nations in the bidding war between 1st vaccine in poor countries vs booster shots in rich ones.\n\n2. We should be very very concerned about why our institutions are giving out horribly bad and wrong advice over and over and over again and lying on so many fronts that they cannot be reasonably trusted. For different reasons than the average pro-ivermectin person, Scott too is calling out the NIH and CDC and WHO for being dead wrong in what they are saying.  \n\nMeanwhile the elites are fixated on expanding their power, giving away profits for publicly funded vaccines to mint more billionaires, and being vaxterical about all alternatives to vaccines as though the devil were coming.  Thanks German and US and UK massive research funding, promises to buy the vaccine even if it didn't work, legal immunity, and all the exclusive IP control which led to record profits!  You did all the work public money and public research bodies....but in terms of hoarding profit.....we'll take it from here.  \n\nAlso, at Big Pharma are clearly motivated by science, Truth with a big T, and caring about you!  Ummm...I'm not sure why the 1st dose of vaccines across Africa wont arrive for most people until 2023 and the vaccines only work for 6 months...we'll umm...look into that, just keep the money flowing for us, thanks!\n\n3. This concern about widespread multiyear repeated Institutional failure about a mild disease triggering an insane reaction should be more of a concern than some pseudoscience folks who listened to the science a little too closely and found a good safe drug that does work to make covid less bad for 80% of Earth's population, but for the 'wrong' reasons.\n\n4. Our entire public health approach seems to be severely flawed where we have a disease problem and a tactic which removes a hurdle or adds support to the immune system is viscously attacked.  Do we want to help people, control a disease, etc. or do we want to only deploy the most highly scientifically researched ideas?  \n\nOr insteadMight we throw everything at it and just use anything that works for any reason as long as it is safe?  Why is one approach the ONLY way and all other ideas wrong...even if every single thing from 'the one true way' has resulted in wrong choices to date?\n\n5. The corruption of science, government, and institutions with oodles of bribe money seems to have narrowed our entire scope of understanding down to things that fit into centralisation, profits, and power expansion to the exclusions and active ridicule of any idea which doesn't promote more elite power, profit, and authority.  Somehow this is left out and is central to distrust growing.\n\nThe longer winded version with more detail of the above points:\n\nI really think Scott might be trapped in a bubble of 'trying really hard to find ways to make the professional/expert/leadership class who are like me' sound more reasonable than they are.  \n\nLargely through omission and a quick acceptance of the fact that they have repeatedly lied, cheated, stolen, engaged in horrifically amoral profit seeking, and killed people by releasing drugs which have been recalled and some which are still on the market despite the fact that they should probably be recalled or have their guidelines changed to be proscribed far less often.  \n\nThis is like excusing Pinochet with 2 sentences as 'a bad guy' and 'we know that, yea' and then fixating on a person who killed 2 people while drunk driving while using shoddy statistics.  The focus just seems a bit....off.  As though a few tweaks to some 'bad science' would somehow fix the atrociously and terribly wrong choices made by every single person in a position of power.\n\nI'm not so concerned that random doctors and the public found that Ivermectin worked, but think it works for the wrong reason....than I am about why all our institutions and experts missed this!  And are stillllll missing it!\n\nThe end goal is clear that 'we need to find a way to trust the RIGHT experts'..as in the ones who are correct.  Which does indeeds sound reasonable and very difficult and also....why in the world had we not already been doing all of this already? Why is there a sea of low standard such that the highest quality journals are still quasi wrong and below good standards most of the time?  Isn't that a bigger problem than folk remedies which work for the wrong reason?\n\nAnd yet, as you said the goal isn't to get negative PCR test, but instead to help people and for people to avoid the disease or become heathy if they do get sick.\n\nSo what should our goal be here?  In terms of deciding what to do. I saw in another comment Scott talked about Pascal's Wager and yet....besides the adjacent Pascal's Mugging concept...this isn't a hypothetical trolley problem or an argument, it is a reality for hundreds of millions of people who've had COVID and what choices we make as a species in terms of how to deal with it.  \n\nMaybe giving out a harmless and in fact beneficial drug which won a Nobel prize is the right thing and the hysterical and objectively insane overreaction to ban it, ban it for all time to irrational promote a VACCINES ONLY policy from all the governments, media, and medical institutions is an obviously wrong approach.  \n\nOne which we have never seen for any other disease and is linked to enormous power and profits....every single red flag should be raised right now to the shoddy and insane logic and approach which we've never seen before where the CDC and NIH and WHO are MORE concerned about stopping people from taking safe drugs which may not work than they are in finding therapeutics.  \n\nI've even seen ads and media talking about not taking vitamin d, not losing weight, and not taking monoclonal antibodies or other treatments.  They are actively advocating against ALL ideas which are not the vaccine.  This has never happened before and is noteworthy. It is vaxteria where news anchors start spitting blood and gnashing their teeth at the thought of anyone doing anything other than get as many vaccines as possible.  This shit isn't normal!\n\nTo me part of this comes down to the incredible set of Western medicine style blinders of 'I need a drug to treat this specific disease directly'.  The Truth with a capital T is all about this somehow....instead of the more holistic Eastern medicine concepts of looking at the overall health of the patient.  In the West if a drug works for the 'wrong' reason, then we should ban it?  \n\nThat's the lesson I'm hearing from all our leadership in all the important sounding places.  It is important to understand mechanisms of action sure...but is that MORE important than throwing everything at the wall and going with anything that helps, even slightly and with limited side effects, during a pandemic?  What should be our guiding star when we have a research system which takes years to come to semi-reliable conclusions while we face an immediate problem of a pandemic which is not going to wait for us?\n\nFor vaccines the answer was to rush the out as best we could...but that approach was used no where else where even basic treatment of patients such as corticosteroids was banned for many months at the start of the pandemic.  Why the different logic, approach, policy in public health?  One side of that equation had billions of profits which minted at least 9 new big pharma investors into the ranks of billionaires and the other options didn't.\n\nSomehow......at the end of the day......we see more profits, more corruption, more centralisation, and more power held by fewer and fewer people to do more things.  \n\nHow could someone not think the goal here is to boost profits when the ONLY idea which is acceptable is to have as many vaccines and booster shots as possible which were all publicly funded, guaranteed, given legal immunity for the lowest risk drug release in history, and then 100% of the options were locked up under IP and private profiteering.\n\nThe ultra strong conclusion I can see from Scott's worms are the problem trollish outcome is that 'this is the best time in history' to expand deworming programs in countries where this is a problem. It is low cost and DOES help people in those countries who get covid to not get as sick, not go to hospital, and to not die from covid.\n\nAlso! there are also many benefits of NOT having parasites which would help them in lots of other ways.  Unless there is some strange pro-parasite movement (aside from the 'it fights celiac disease' somehow) I don't know about.\n\nSomehow we're fixated nitty gritty of the dog bites man story here and ignoring the man bites dog story!",

I'm very much surrounded by ivermectin proponents and vaccine/mask skeptics.  \n\nMy personal perspective has been rooted in the Critical Rationalism of Karl Popper and deontological ethics.  Overall, COVID has been dominated by consequentialism and Scientific Instrumentalism.  Hopefully, people have learned that we should NEVER trust experts for being experts, only consider their arguments and more importantly their explanations.  Also, that science is not an instrument for pushing a political agenda, but a process to seek out the best explanations for why the natural world is the way it is.  Hume taught us a long time ago that you cannot get an ought from an is, but that is exactly the dominant message during COVID.  This, along with people being bombarded with ad hominems and other logical fallacies from \"authorities\" I fear the next pandemic will be more catastrophic as both sides double down.  All-in-all this has been an epic failure of hubris on the part of \"experts\".  \n\nSorry, ended up posting way more than the simple \"Thanks!\" I intended.",

Black people have been harmed by scientists in the past, and there are few black scientists now, so they need to increase black confidence in science (black people are more likely to be unvaccinated) by forcing everyone to promote minority scientists even if they aren't the most qualified. Now try to deliberately add conservative scientists through non-meritocratic methods, and there won't be any space left for real talent. In such a polarized society, you can't please everyone. What needs to happen, is judgment by results and getting people to downplay the actual demographics of scientists. \nNow this is a general problem with communication of science. The scientifically proven ways of convincing people are very different from the scientific method. Therefore, the scientific method can't defend itself well, because if it use the scientific process, people won't listen, and if it uses arguments that work, those won't be the real reasons.",

But from far enough away, it all looks like one big black box labelled Authority which spits out pronouncements, and lately these pronouncements have been getting less and less reliable, the black box is lurching and making a weird grinding noise and a lot of acrid smoke, and the guys with batons who tell you to believe the Authority's pronouncements are getting more and more aggressive. From that far away it's getting pretty tempting to say \"You know what? Screw the Authority box and everything it says\"",

It's been known for years that correct levels of vitamine D are essential for a healthy immune system and the majority of people who had a problem with Covid-19 were deficient, especially children, more than 90%, yet I've never seen one public service notice informing people they should have their level checked, among the thousands telling people to issolate, wear masks, and take an experimental vaccine that doesn't stop people from getting infected, it reduces the symptoms, which makes it more likely they'll spread the disease, while causing the virus to adapt to a more contagious form. The establishment's failure to study and explain the huge spike in adverse reactions reported on VAERS, and the imposition of mandates, has created a perfect storm, undermining people's faith in government and private institutions, making it appear they're colluding for some nefarious purpose. Knowing there's an information channel between the CDC and Big Tech censoring people, makes me very suspicious,          ",

For children, evidence shows that the experimental vaccines are more dangerous than COVID-19, that's why countries who's health departments aren't controlled by Big Pharma stopped giving them to people under 30. The virus that causes COVID-19 is a very dangerous bio-weapon, and when when treatment options are suppressed by the WHO and CDC to maintain the EUA necessary for Big Pharma to make thousands of dollars a second, with zero liability, even more dangerous. The pandemic needs a multi dimensional response, The one size fits all approach the CDC advocated couldn‚Äôt work, but those who understood were censured and censored. The use of multiple boosters wasn‚Äôt even studied, but they‚Äôre going ahead with them, why not, they have zero liability and doing so will make then even more big bucks. ",

That may not feel fair to you, but nobody can single-handedly control the conversation on anything, you just have to play it where it lies.\n\n(I am also unconvinced that bigger RCTs are \"the right thing\" - as I said in my second paragraph, they *did* do two bigger RCTs and didn't find anything.)",

He then dishes out these pills whenever one of his neighbours get sick. He gains a reputation as a great healer because a significant proportion of his patients are miraculously cured.  Kaptchuk likens this to the Western approach to Chinese medicine where we 'do acupuncture' and 'use herbs', but we don't have a deep understanding of why it works.\n\nI was reminded of this parable when reading Scott's description of the effect of Invermectin with helminths.\n\nIf you give Ivermectin to everyone with COVID, maybe a proportion of them will get miraculously better. But without a deep understanding of how it works, we can't say why ...\n\n",

Your conclusions regarding ivermectin seem very reasonable.\n\nTowards the end, you unfortunately abandoned your neutral position and vilified vaccine-deniers by calling us crazy. That is not true. We can be perfectly reasonable people who simply do not see a compelling reward vs. risk in favor of vaccines in the calculus of our lives. In my assessment, the safety of vaccines is an oft-repeated mantra but is not actually backed up with scientific evidence. There are many hypotheses about potential vaccine harm, informed based on real world signals, that have generally gone untested due to political forces. ‚ÄãAt the same time, the risk of my children dying from chicken pox, measles, polio, COVID, etc, appears to be exceedingly low.\n\nIt is great and magnanimous to be neutral in our assessments, to focus on facts and evidence, to approach others with respect and accept that we might be able to learn something from them.",

The risk of *your* children dying or being paralyzed from polio is exceedingly low because other people, much more numerous than skeptical vaccine-deniers like you, do vaccinate *their* children. As for comparative risk, know why FDR was mostly confined to his wheelchair all his adult life? You can get some 100-year old books and newspaper articles written in American English long before polio vaccines were invented and learn what it was like. I won't recommend 200- and 300-year old books (also written in English) because standards of hygiene and public health improved bigly in late XIX century, but you must be aware what childhood mortality figures were before that.",

These findings, along with the early evidence for reduced levels of viral mRNA and culturable virus in vaccinated people who acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggest that any associated transmission risk is substantially reduced in vaccinated people: even for Delta, evidence suggests fully vaccinated people who become infected are infectious for shorter periods of time than unvaccinated people infected with Delta.\"\n\n\"Evidence suggests the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program has substantially reduced the burden of disease in the United States by preventing serious illness in fully vaccinated people and interrupting chains of transmission. Vaccinated people can still become infected and have the potential to spread the virus to others, although at much lower rates than unvaccinated people.\"\n",

It's on display here.  \n\nNow I don't like to start off with what appears like an attack, but a little pain can lead to gain.\n\nEvidence. The observational evidence for IVM is strong. The clinical RCT evidence is weaker, but its there.  The mechanistic evidence is strong. But perhaps most importantly, the real world anecdotal of US-based physicians like the Dr. Varon (\"The Covid Hunter\") or Dr. Barody (\"Heliobacter Triple Therapy\") and many others  - it's very very very notable.  So we're left to explain the literate simpleton.\n\nIt's not a character flaw, it is a failure to understand reality outside of academia where you try to isolate.\n\nIf you go to a court of law, RCT+observational evidence+real world anecodotal+mechanistic evidence = cause = conviction = proven.  That's the real world.  That's how we convict criminals \nlike Monsanto, and hopefully one day Pfizer.  \n\nIvermectin works in combination therapies.  You can prove that out just looking at Japan - not a big parasite country.\n\nAs for your current understanding of \"tracking\" - I think it is safe to say you don't know Lenz Law, which is 2nd year physics, without which you can't understand a lot of biotechnology that already exists. So when you say \"impossible with current technology\" you sound like a fool.  I'm not arguing for \"microchipping\" in the sense you think, in fact I know that's not the case. \nThere is no space to expound on how advanced electromagnetic tech is suffice to say\nthat in Sweden they already scan their wrist at checkout, and that is old \ntechnology. I'm not arguing for any conspiracy so you can stick me with a simpleton\nhot poker, like \"vaccine denialism\" suggest you are apt to do.\n\nAs for the vaccines which is the most important matter at hand, the danger is the spike protein - it's a toxin, it causes clotting, it causes hyperinflamation, it is a prion, it enters the  nucleus and can impact DNA. It's in the vaccine and in Sars-Cov-2.  \n\nNow reassess everything you thought was good about the vaccines. You don't need to understand immunology for that.\n\nFinally, if you are a parent (anyone) and want to help your kids we'll soon have a course up on the science and a learning community, signup for The Discovery Force for free: mercy.school\nI am not concerned about microentanglements on blogs, but about saving our youngest from a lot of pain.",

They didn't notice that it was killing vast numbers of their patients because practising doctors are too close to the problem. \n\nThrow in biases like doctors prescribing drugs to patients they \"feel\" it might help without blinding or randomisation and you've got a recipe for people to utterly delude themselves.\n\nIn general the opinion of a GP or ER doctor vs professional researcher with statisticians behind them... the former is one of the lowest tiers of evidence for good reason.

You are telling yourself a simple story -- pay attention to what you are saying -- \"biases like doctors prescribing drugs to patients they might \"feel\" -- thats a simple story.  But observational evidence from someone like Dr. Varon using it day, in day out, in a practical sense is more than a simple story -- it is a living test tube.  You can't put that into excel so you dismiss it - thats truly pathetic.\n\nhttps://www.bitchute.com/video/PpLfu7LL2TLh/\n\nIf you are young, this story will end with you figuring out why Ionnidis says Most Published Findings are Wrong: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/\nbut even more, why something that can have breakthrough effect can be hard to \"prove statistically\" in the  midst of a dynamic situation - and even when it is, the net effect may be hard to pin point.  Unless and until you do more work, which you have to here, including using it on your own patients -- because having someone leave your office and be told to go to the ER when they turn blue -- isn't exactly smart.  Meaning not giving early treatments is one of the greatest, if not greatest failing in medical history.\n\nAnd you're on the web trying to teach me about science.\n\nThink about it.\n ",

Don't _believe_ science, _understand_ it. If you _understood_ science, you would know that telling people to believe it is the most anti-science thing you can do\n\nScience isn't an authority handing down diktats from on high. Science is a process. ANYBODY can do that process, +/- expensive equipment. In fact, we rely on that; we hope that multiple people try to do the same science independently and then we compare their results!\n\nI was accused of \"not believing in science\" last year because I rejected most of the mainstream public narratives about covid. But the reason I rejected them was because they were false. I know, because for six months I spent almost three hours a night reading medical research preprints linked on r/covid19 and trying to draw conclusions. \n\nWhat I was doing was more \"science\" than anyone who \"believes\" in it has ever done. I wish society was not trying so aggressively to dissuade people from doing this, in favour of mindless deference to people who, while under oath, have admitted to knowingly lying to the American people for policy-convenience reasons (the whole mask thing, eg)",

Exactly like Scott did here!\n\nPart of the problem here is that science popularizers and politicians who \"follow the science\" are imputing WAY WAY WAY too much certainty to their comments (or, if not, they are implying it, possibly accidentally, in a bad way). When I ask myself, hey does ivermectin work, and I see all of these studies, I say \"probably; who knows, we might have a proper answer in ten years. In the mean time, it's cheap and relatively safe so don't be an idiot but you might as well take it\". When these public \"scientists\" (very rarely actual scientists) look at the same studies, they don't say \"eeh these results are inconclusive, it probably doesn't work\". They say \"IT DOESN'T WORK, ITS OBVIOUS IT DOESN'T WORK, ANYONE WHO THINKS IT WORKS IS EITHER STUPID OR LYING\". \n\nBasically nothing in science deserves that level of confidence. Hell, even when science \"officially\" \"blesses\" a result with p <0.05, that just says (handwaving; I'm not a scientist sorry if I get this wrong) there's a less than 5% chance that this happened randomly. <5% is 1 in 20. Every single thing that science says is true can be false 1 in 20 times and science still says its true, because that's the best we can do. A 5% error rate is way, way too high to justify the level of certainty that our science communicators have",

There are two times when they get shouty:\n-People publish studies that are highly flawed or even made up, claiming extreme effectiveness for ivm\n-People who should know better include these highly flawed or made up studies in their results, claiming extreme effectiveness for ivm\n\nTheir opinions differ on whether ivm has a good chance of being 8% effective at preventing deaths. They do not get shouty about this. The shouts happen when extreme claims of 90% effectiveness are made & used. Note that extreme claims are less likely to be true. \n\nThe studies with extreme claims are covered in red flags, and near-universal scientific training tells you how to look for those flags; accredited researchers generally know whether to treat a given study as being actually 95% or not. They get shouty at researchers who ignore red flags that they think should be obvious, because if the researchers know better than to ignore them then they're probably not being objective.\n\nNote that this is a small group. There will be other experts whose experience with IVM advocacy is not known, some of whom have different policies on when to shout. And there is also the media and social media which is full of non-experts. They make most of the noise and have the least knowledge. If you allow these categories to mix you're gonna blame the debunkers for other people's actions.\n\nSide note, the standard way to count a result as proven is p<.05, frequentist-style. Different fields may have harsher p-values or may have moved further into Bayes-land. But in general scientists wouldn't consider something Theory based on one p<.05 result; making Theory requires multiple experiments from multiple angles & multiple parties, followed by a period of waiting to see if a grouchy old professor will publish an angry letter that points out how it's all flawed.",

            "body": "> But the basic issue - that the vaccine works really well and is incredibly safe for adults - seems beyond question. Yet people keep questioning it.\n\nThe vaccine comes with an unacceptably high risk of fascism, and if you ignore this you will be extremely confused as to why a ton of normal, regular, not-stupid-at-all people are making the rational decision to not get vaccinated. \n\nI believe that the vaccines probably work more than zero. I believe the _health_ benefits probably outweigh the risks (however, not for me; I already had covid so either I'm immune and it doesn't matter, or I'm ok with how sick I got if I get that sick again, so it doesn't matter). I'm still not getting it. The split second our governing institutions decided it was reasonable to say \"get vaccinated or we will destroy your life and end society\", my mind was made up. Even if that means fifty million Americans die (I don't believe that, but even if), well, on the order of fifty million people died the last time we stopped fascism and if you so much as question that cost-benefit analysis you get accused of being a Nazi. \n\nIn fact, if I wanted to be really cheeky I might say that the fact that the vaccine probably works _increases_ my hesitancy. If it was a bs vaccine that did nothing, the choice of whether to take it or not take it is meaningless. If the vaccine actually works, then refusing to take it is a costly, credible signal of \"no, we're serious, these lockdowns are unacceptable\". \n\nFor anyone who wants to try and change my mind, these are my requirements:\n\nSomeone has to give me an explanation for why I need to get immunized despite already having had covid. The explanation cannot involve either a) any reason that reduces to \"there's no medical reason but it's easier for the government to track vax status than immunity status\" (because the government enacting unacceptable measures for their own convenience is my entire problem!); or b) \"immunity is temporary so get vaccinated\" (because that immediately implies that I will have to get booster shots every year _forever_, which means that accepting the mandate means accepting a _permanent_ mandate, and that's unacceptable)\n\nSomeone has to give me a credible demonstration of remorse on the part of the government. At this point, the demonstration has to be something along the lines of \"Dr. Fauci is executed in public, where I can see it so I know it's not a deep fake\", or something equally costly. Not because I think he needs to be executed (though wouldn't shed a tear if he was), but rather because I have so little trust in anything the government says, it would take a signal that costly to convince me they're being honest\n\nSomeone has to give me a credible commitment to both the current restrictions being eliminated entirely, returning our society to the way it was in 2019, and also a credible commitment that this will NEVER. HAPPEN. AGAIN. No matter how bad the next pandemic is. I cannot think of a way in which the government could demonstrate enough credibility to convince me of this. (remember how they said they would totally never mandate vaccines and then three months later they made it law?)\n\nSomeone has to convince me that my getting vaccinated will nearly-immediately and permanently exempt me from _all_ covid restrictions. Given that almost every polity on the planet has already said this _and then backpedaled it_, I don't think its possible to convince me of this anymore. \n\nSomeone has to get me a formal apology from a high profile public figure for systematically emphasizing the worst and most socially costly measures possible (ie \"we will throw you in jail if you try to go to work\") while ignoring obvious low hanging fruit (\"we will throw you in jail if you don't go to the gym and lose 20 lbs\", etc). \n\nI estimate the probability of achieving _any_ of the above items as 0+Œµ%, nevermind all of them.

Then they all flipped on a dime on January 20th. More importantly, they flipped on a dime without explaining why they flipped, and without even acknowledging that they flipped. \n\nIt's all fine and good to write off vax deniers as ignorant rednecks (I am NOT saying scott did this). However, curiously, the only people I heard who disavowed Harris and Biden saying \"don't take a Trump Vaccine\" are Trumpy people. \n\nThe currently elected united states federal government directly and intentionally created the anti-vax backlash against the _current_ vaccine, in order to win an election. Any discussion of anti-vaxxers that doesn't prominently raise this happening is missing an important detail",

They were concerned about Trump interfering with the CDC and FDA as he had been shown to do, and, they were concerned that perhaps he would force approval of the vaccine prematurely.    He had voiced his desire to get the vaccines approved before the election.    They did not flip on a dime.   They waited for FDA approval , which happened after the election.   Perhaps there was some politics involved.  I think most observers would take that into account.\nIf you are concerned about how US politics informed vaccine approval, try looking at how other countries handled the process.  Nobody approved the western vaccines before Nov 5.",

            "body": "> Again, ivermectin optimism isn‚Äôt exactly like vaccine denialism - it‚Äôs a less open-and-shut question, you can still make a plausible argument for it.\n\nUsing this as a jumping off point for one of my pet peeves. \n\nVaccine denialism is ABSOLUTELY NOT an open and shut case. Its an open-and-shut _medical_ case. But there are more things in heaven and earth, ACX, than are dreamt of in your medicine. \n\nThis is a thing that happens _a lot_ in politics/policy discussions, and rationalists tend to be especially bad at it (probably an artifact of them being disproportionately likely to be policy wonks). Alice decides to do a cost/benefit analysis to justify doing a thing. Bob doesn't want them to do a thing, and has some reasons. Alice wants to do the thing and is looking to justify it. Alice runs her cost/benefit analysis and comes up with some costs and some benefits. Then she looks at the costs column and crosses out 2/3rds of them because \"that doesn't matter\"\n\nExcept it matters to Bob. But Alice, trying to control the frame, simply doesn't acknowledge the concern and tries to get everyone to ignore those costs.\n\nSure, there's 'no reasonable cause to oppose covid vaccines'  if you restrict your thinking to only medical (Note: I do not concede this; I think there is something real and significant going on wrt the severe reactions and deaths. I have no idea how big/significant it is, but I know that that when basically the entire world will try to get you fired simply for asking that question, you cannot trust their answers, ever. My current estimate is \"it's real, its significantly higher than the risk of other vaccines, it is probably safer than actually getting covid +/- specific demographic and risk factors (ie covid might be safer than vaccine for teenagers on the ground that only about 600 people under age 18 have died of covid in the US, ever, which is basically a rounding error away from zero in a nation of half a billion (https://www.statista.com/statistics/1191568/reported-deaths-from-covid-by-age-us/). I've also seen some things suggesting cause for concern in vaccinating people who have already recovered from covid, but I haven't dived into that enough to know if it's just noise or not)\n\n\nHowever, if someone's response to my very reasonable social and political concerns is \"lol those don't count. 'Muh rights', lol moron, can't you see people are dying??!?!?!\", then of course they're going to think they are obviously right and I am ridiculously denying an obvious good out of nothing but stubbornness.\n\n(For a bit-flipped example, consider if it would be reasonable to accept significant curtailments of African-Americans' rights, on the ground that the 2020 BLM riots killed more people than the n word ever did, and if they didn't have rights, they couldn't riot. Even the most racist far right extremists I know would think that that's ridiculous, and yet this is the same principle of reasoning people are using for lockdowns. \"Fuck your rights, people died, nothing else matters until they stop\". If you have a right to free assembly, you might spread covid. If you don't have a right to free assembly, you can't spread covid)\n\nBasically literally every time you have a social policy that does not have >95% consensus in the general public, you should start with the assumption that it's very much NOT an open-and-shut question. If it was, a ton of people would not disagree with you! And in case you think this is an unreasonable standard: I will pay out $5000 USD to anyone who can convince me that >5% of Americans sincerely believe that (eg) murder should not be illegal. there is overwhelming consensus that murder is bad, and so murder is illegal and nobody disputes this. (Even the people who believe that some _killings_ should be legal, do not concede that those killings are murder, and still agree that murder is bad). \"Is murder good or bad?\" is actually an open-and-shut case. \"Are vaccines good?\" is not, if for no other reason than that like a third of the country says 'no'. \n\nWhat has ground my gears about this whole thing even more is that the corporate press, the blogosphere, social media, everything, has been telling us for over a year how we're surrounded by 30% of the country who are crazy and don't believe science. You know what I have NEVER seen ANY of them (including present company) do? Actually ask an anti-vaxxer why they're anti-vax. On the very rare occasion when something like this happens, they get the most ridiculous moron on and paint the whole group like that, instead of asking one of the literally millions of regular normal Americans why they have decided this\n\nAnd I promise you, if you did this, you would find that a large majority of vaccine-hesitancy is driven by politics, and you would find that most of those political positions are not unreasonable.\n\nSpeaking personally, I am still at a loss how to have these discussions sometime because what has happened in the past two years is actually, seriously, sincerely, no-joke, Hitler/Stalin level evil. To bring one example at random: my home province shut down everything, no exception for churches. A handful of very religious communities who belong to my tiny ethnic minority group said that Jesus is more important, come make us stop. The government dispatched police to their rural communities to physically prevent them from worshipping\n\nTHEN, the state started running ad campaigns, spinning press releases, etc., to push the narrative of \"those evil, selfish minorities, who think going to church is more important than saving lives, are why we have an outbreak now\" and started stoking overt racial hatred against us. Which, in addition to being almost mustache-twirlingly, cartoonishly evil, is also ridiculous; a bunch of rural conservative farmers who live three hours' drive from the nearest city CANNOT have any meaningful impact on a disease that requires close contact to spread. \n\nEven with how crazy society has been going lately, if you had asked me in 2019 \"will the government, in your lifetime, make church illegal and send people to jail for worshipping Jesus, for any reason\", I would have laughed you out of the room. _**That literally happened last year**_. Maybe it was necessary for the greater good (I do not concede this). But that is sufficiently extreme that, if nothing else, it should have come along with extremely vigourous public debate. Instead it came along with half a million Canadians uncritically accepting that my ethnic group is intentionally spreading covid because fuck everyone else. (Remember when all of society agreed that blaming the Chinese for spreading Covid was horrible evil racism? Why the disparate treatment?)\n\nThey made going to work illegal and disrupted communities and social bonds. They got churches to voluntarily shut down (and did it by force in some places). They took away everything that made life worth living. They justified tons of political and electoral incompetence and corruption on the grounds of \"it's covid\". They let crime and violence run rampant and even had the gall to publicize op-eds claiming that rioters don't spread covid, only you and I do. They printed trillions of dollars and caused inflation worse than anything we've seen in my _or my parents'_ generation. They broke the supply chain causing massive shortages of input intermediary goods that we still haven't seen the full consequences of. They eroded high trust society, getting everyone to snitch on each other and enforce arbitrary and capricious rules. \n\nAgain, even if you think all of this was necessary (it wasn't), that doesn't account for why so many people went along with this _gleefully_, instead of taking the tone of \"this is horrible but it's what we have to do\". But this is a horrible, egregious harm to millions of people. (Hell, hate to be so blunt about it, but I currently know of 6 people who killed themselves over lockdowns and 1 person who died of covid, if anyone really wants to do a deep cost/benefit analysis). Just because the damage is abstracted and spread throughout society, instead of highly legible and visible like eg a war, doesn't mean the damage is any less real. \n\nI have no meaningful ability to change this. I can't take up arms and overthrow the government, for obvious reasons. I can't even vote here, I'm not a citizen. What I can do is engage in costly protest. The people who locked us down last year, are now telling me to get vaccinated. They have not compensated for last year or apologized to me. So now, I don't get the vaccine. Purely because I want those people to be mad that they can't achieve their vaccine policy goal. Because that is the only protest available to me. \n\nThis is a reasonable basis on which to make medical decisions, and casually writing it off as \"it's an open-and-shut case and no reasonable person could possibly be against these vaccines\" is intellectually dishonest\n",

The comparisons to fascism/communism are somewhere between nauseating and just overly melodramatic. I would favor a comparison to taxes to support your local school district.\n\nWe live in a society, cooperation for the betterment of the community is a good thing, and this is all civics 101 is far as I'm concerned. I don't understand why conservatives hate society so much but it greatly saddens me.\n\nI don't think anyone was jailed for going to work in Canada or the US. I think some (not many) people in the west were jailed for violating covid lockdowns, but if anything I think the lockdowns were mostly a joke, and this was a serious failure of the state to act forcefully to protect its citizens.\n\nI don't think lockdowns are going to be permanent, except maybe in the very loose sense of more people working from home (which I consider a good thing, both for my personal circumstances and for society generally).\n\nAgain, I think in a very real sense you and I are just not living in the same world at all.

They're in a tough spot. \n\n (2) What disappoints me about this article is lack of cost-benefit analysis, loosely speaking. It's all about effectiveness, the benefit, which is dubious outside of wormy countries, high in wormy countries. What about cost? My impression is that the side-effects are minimal, tho it's unclear whether there are mild-but-bothersome  side effects at the doses claimed to be effective for covid (side effects like those of vaccines, headaches and a half-day of work lost).  The dollar cost is very low for sheep-and-horse ivermectin, closer to $100 for Indiana human pills.  Is this correct? If so, it makes sense to go get some sheep dewormer if you feel sick. ",

            "body": "This is flat out the absolute best essay on our Covid 19 mess in the USA I've read to date.   It also confirms something I've long suspected: that Ivermectin has been successful for some because it dealt with the unknown underlying problem of parasitical infection (more common tha realized), and thereby strengthened the body's natural immune response.   It would also explain why Covid came back on some and not others:  some people are exposed to parasites on a daily basis (farm workers for example)  who would go back to their regular life and get reinfected, while for others it might be a one time thing (remote vacation site in a third world country).\nThis essay also deserves an award for its wholly compassionate and honest explanation for why so many do not trust \"science\".  Like the author, I am fortunate to have real scientists in my life, including one who IS a microbiological research engineer who focuses on vaccines and one who was on a lead research team at a major university.   I would defer to their judgement on ANY vaccine.  I  also have family who at the opposite end.  The amazing thing is that the science deniers in the family are all college educated, three are in the medical field.  However, this essay has helped me to understand and respect their positions.

I'm the following months I learned a lot of new things (for me at least) about human nature, politics and the dynamics of groups. Over a full year Taiwan had below 10 deaths while my rich, western country with only 1/3 of the inhabitants had a steady death toll from 5000 till 10000 people. I had aot of discussions both with smart partly smart and not so smart people.\nRight now after 'twi years of private research' I have to admit I was warned but did not take the warnings serious, no I was young, unreasonable optimistic if not naive about humanity.

            "body": "I've been skeptical of vaccines and pro-ivermectin. I know my thinking and personal research in this matter has directly influenced public opinion leaders, who are anti-vax and pro-ivm. Collectively their loyal audiences are in the tens of thousands.\n\nHere's my thinking.\n\nI believe that in the short term the current vaccines are safer than the data suggests, because only the English-speaking world is dumb enough to inject without aspirating, so a significant proportion of the vaccine shots end up in the bloodstream, causing all sorts of side effects, including heart problems and clotting.\n\nWe know from experiments on mice that the mRNA vaccines cause complications when injected into bloodstream. Unlike every other vaccine previously, the modern ones can ONLY be injected safely into muscle tissue, but English-speaking countries are not taking precautions to make sure that muscle is where the vaccine ends up.\n\nWhy would I listen to some government expert telling me to vaccinate when the people doing the vaccinations can't even read manufacturer instructions telling them to only inject into muscle, which is a procedure, which requires aspiration?\n\nEven China is aspirating when injecting their vaccine, even though theirs is a traditional vaccine, which can be injected safely into bloodstream.\n\nLong term safety data on the current vaccine technology does not exist, but there is some worrying initial data coming out. What we know is that the vaccine-expressed spike protein does leave the cell attached to exosomes and these exosomes with spike proteins can stay around for months. And recently a study found that the spike protein itself enters the cell nucleus and impairs DNA damage repair, leading to possible cell death or cancer: https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/13/10/2056\n\nNeither of these data points are significant enough to change our risk calculations right now, but I would not judge anyone, who decides to not vaccinate based on the inherent uncertainty that such new technology always has.\n\nI'm glad that we have mRNA-vaccines and I hope this technology has a bright future, but if some people want to remain part of the control group, they should have that opportunity. I respect everyone, who was brave enough to take the experimental vaccine.\n\nAs for ivermectin and other drugs that seem to have some positive effect and a known safety profile, then my opinion is that during an actual pandemic all such options should be on the table and people who wish to volunteer for drug trials should be able to do so.\n\nHad I gotten covid yesterday, I would have voluntarily chosen to be part of an ivermectin/placebo RCT, given the opportunity. After reading your worm hypothesis, however, I would make a different calculation tomorrow. I would probably choose another drug trial to participate in.\n\nSo what's the difference between rejecting the risk of vaccination and accepting the risk of an unproven medical treatment? We know the vaccination works. We don't know that the medical treatment works. There's maybe 10x higher chance of death in the second option, given my personal health risks.\n\nWhy would I be willing to knowingly accept 10x more risk going for a treatment trial, rather than a vaccination? Because if the treatment works, that will be a significant discovery, which might effectively end the pandemic. Vaccinations won't do that, because they're not good enough to reach herd immunity, even if everyone trusted the government and got vaccinated.\n\nAnd when we're talking about possible experimental treatments, which might help significantly if rolled out globally during a crisis, we should first look at drugs and classes of drugs, which have a known safety profile, rather than completely new things. One such drug is Paxlovid, which is a 3CL protease inhibitor. I wouldn't mind taking that, because that class of drugs has been in use for decades. And if Paxlovid lives up to its claims, it will actually end the pandemic globally. Unlike the current vaccines.",

I enjoy the idea of a cosmic joke where ivermectin sort of works in some senses in some areas. But the things people were claiming - that ivermectin has a 100% success rate, that you don‚Äôt need to take the vaccine because you can just take ivermectin instead, etc.\" Can you provide links to any prominent ivermectin supports saying these things? Maybe someone on the Internet is claiming 100% success rate, but you can probably find someone on the Internet for any claim. How prevalent/prominent is your characterization of ivermectin supporters?\n\n5. For such a thoughtful article, it felt like the big conclusion was so thinly supported. Okay, so worms. But do we have studies where worms are accounted for as a variable such that we can confirm or deny your conclusion? \"If we remove the studies done in places where worms are common, the results aren't as strong, so worms explains the strength of the results\" feels like such a thin argument, how is it better than so many other half-baked ideas about Covid that are out there?\n\nFeels like there are a lot of facile ideas out there. The antidote to that is to dig deep into the studies, something you did admirably. But then you topped it off with a conclusion that feels just as facile as the ideas your analysis is supposed to be an antidote to. It's interesting as an *hypothesis*, but very dissatisfying that it's presented as a conclusion.\n\nAnyways, the rest of the article is commendable, and better than most mainstream journalism out there, so still appreciative of what you've done here.",

The refusal is simply in response to the obvious lies and gaslighting that has occurred throughout the pandemic, combined with the unquestionable cover-up of serious vaccine injuries.  The CDC was wrong about so much, and they moved the goalposts with the vaccine every time a new failure was discovered (it doesn't stop infection or transmission but it reduces symptoms, as long as you got it within the last 6 months).  Myocarditis was clearly a problem but the CDC was slow to act.  We see clear evidence with our own eyes that people are getting seriously injured after taking the vaccine, but the CDC won't acknowledge even these public cases... What else are they not acknowledging?  A whistleblower tells us Pfizer altered data... But nobody seems to care.  The FDA what's until 2076 to show us all the data they used to make their authorization decision, and we're not supposed to bat an eye.\n\nThese drug companies have BILLIONS in fines for their criminal misbehavior.  The FDA has a history of approving drugs that need to be recalled later.  The CDC failed over and over again to give us reliable information... And last, I see dozens of me friends and neighbors getting Covid and recovering without incident.  I have assessed my risk, found it to be low, and see no need to take a leaky vaccine every 6 months to protect me from something I'll get over fine on my own. ",

This alone and being forced to do something while not being able to speak freely is a big SMACK in the face for freedom.

During the 1918 flu pandemic it was estimated that 1/3 of people got sick with the virus - symptomatic infections.   In order to reach herd immunity there would have been 70+ % of the population that had gotten infected, but did not get sick enough (or at all) to get counted.    A much greater death toll (per capita) \n than we have seen with Covid-19 was the result of not managing the pandemic.   If you slow down infection rates to spare the hospitals, then you are only prolonging the pandemic, while burning out hospital staff.   \n\nYes, at least where I live there are ongoing studies monitoring all aspects of the pandemic.   Detailed reports are available online.   They took some time to decide if boosters were a good idea.  These decisions are not taken lightly.  \nIf you are concerned about whether bad pandemic decisions are being made due to political motives,  look around the world where vaccines are being relied on regardless of the ideology of the government of the day.",

So, yes, the vaccine trials were done in record time.  This was done because of the urgency of the need for a vaccine and it was possible because of the resources (money) put into it AND because the virus became so prevalent, it was easy to gather the data during the trials.    The underlying technology to the vaccines was not new,  just the makeup of the mRNA.   It is a bit like if you had a blueberry flavoured ice cream and you suddenly needed to make raspberry flavour.

This is why the first article I linked found what it found - people with Delta are only continuing to produce antibodies to the spike protein for the old \"Original\" strain. \n\nBut note, anyone who'd been infected with the old \"Original\" strain would have the same problem.  But at least they'd also have antibodies to an array (up to 28 or so) of nucleocapsid proteins, which so far variant-to-variant do not seem to have changed as much as the spike protein.\n\nhttps://www.jimmunol.org/content/202/2/335\n",

The cost benefits of this are wildly good.\n\nGeneral health improving measures (mitigating parasite damage, encouraging proper diet and exercise, and getting enough sun) should *always* be promoted.

How does it not obey the relative factors of infectiousness of the two disease? \n\nIt appears to me, we had outright fraudulent data on the Flu during COVID: 2020- 2021 we have stopped measuring the Flu, or started attributing it's deaths to COVID.\n\nWhat were the criteria for a death to be reported as COVID again, anyways?

It refers to R, the exponential change in infections per generation. Covid likely had an R of at least 3 in the early outbreaks. Flu seasons typically look like they have R's around 1.3 at peak growth.\n\nSuppose those are the starting R values, and social distancing divides both R's by 2. Then each flu generation would get only 65% as many infections as the last one, so its count decreases. Covid would get 150% as many infections each generation, so it increases until it gets counteracted by immunity. We get a covid wave and minimal flu.\n\nThis predicts what we saw with Australia's flu season in 2020 given their covid cases. They prevented covid from infecting or killing more than a small fraction of their population over the winter months (which for them means June-August because hemispheres). In fact their covid counts were well below their typical flu counts. We would then expect their flu counts to be extremely low, which is what they reported. If they were instead misdiagosing a typical flu season as covid, they would have reported more covid.\n\nIf you wished to make an objective analysis of potential flu fraud I'd suggest figuring out how many outpatient flu diagnoses happened per year before 2020. The incentive allegation should not apply to people who did not go to the hospital. There's no reason for those to go unreported in 2020-21 unless there were few infections to diagnose.",

However, I question the claims of safety (not very quantitative term) in the short term long term safety data is not available because not enough time has passed. Additionally, even the six month study just released earlier this month unblinded the placebo arm and gave vaccine after 2ish months, to name just one flaw in the \"mountain of evidence.\"\n\n\nDoes that sound good to you? Below is from study that supported FDA and other agency approvals:\n\n\n\"During the blinded, placebo-controlled period, 15 participants in the BNT162b2 group and 14 in the placebo group died; during the open-label period, 3 participants in the BNT162b2 group and 2 in the original placebo group who received BNT162b2 after unblinding died. None of these deaths were considered to be related to BNT162b2 by the investigators.

I realize the PIs in those cases didn't think to test for that. \n\nHowever, if these 3 trials were confounded by roundworm infections, then it occurs to me that the control groups in those cases should be compared to control groups in Western trials (where no roundworm infection is suspected) - and should have done, comparatively, significantly much worse than the control groups in Western trials if the theory of the mechanism for the roundworm confounder is correct.\n\nHave you looked at such a comparison?",

UP dropped its curves very fast -- sorry its' not flukes https://juanchamie.substack.com/p/ivermectin-in-uttar-pradesh\n\nYour construction that it is \"all weight of evidence\" vs \"one propensity matched study\" (btw propensity matched studies are well done and near RCT quality) is broken.  You ask a malformed question and then want an answer. \n\nAt this point you truly don't understand scientific evidence if you demand a perfect, large US-based, multimillion dollar study to use a drug that is working around the world, whilst Pharma is churning out drugs (and even stopping studies early on them because they work).\n\nThe level of Real World University science knowledge has never been lower.  \n\n\n",

The irony is I sent you a well done study with a great effect, and then you want me to prove your broken malformed assertion that ('so many well done studies fail to show an effect').  Even if that is true, I can't prove anything about that but I on a one off basis I could give a mechanistic explanation -- the simplest -- RCTs demand rigor and the patients often have to present and then be randomized which can take days.  Early treatment works early.  Hows' that logic for you?\n\nIt is possible to have 100% of RCTs fail, but the drug could be the most powerful drug in history for the condition.  That's Real World University.\n\nI suggest you also talk to clinicians who have used the drug on many patients  \nI have entire archives of papers and thoughts on science and discovery, but this a comment box wouldnt do it justice.",

                                    "body": "Hey Adam-\n\nRegarding your first question, while COVID19 pneumonia looks like organizing pneumonia on imaging, pathology studies overwhelming show diffuse alveolar damage is the pathological pattern (ref: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41379-020-00661-1). Furthermore, studies of steroids in other respiratory illnesses where diffuse alveolar damage is the predominant pattern of injury (like undifferentiated ARDS) have been equivocal. So, I think you're being a bit glib about the idea that \"someone would figure out that steroids would work.\"\n\nHOWEVER, I take your point that it's apples and oranges because dexamethasone is a therapy for inpatients so someone with a profit motive for preventing ivermectin uptake they wouldn't care so much about dexamethasone. So in that case, why hasn't the same thing happened with inhaled budesonide? (ref: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01744-X/fulltext). This is a generic drug that has shown, in a much more rigorous way than anything I have seen for ivermectin, to have efficacy. How come the same forces you think are trying to keep ivermectin down aren't doing the same for inhaled budesonide, which physicians are prescribing? And by the same token, why isn't there the same enthusiasm for budesonide as there is for ivermectin? Again I know these questions come off as confrontational and that's not my intention...I just want to know where you're coming from! \n\nFinally, I think it's truly wonderful times in science, especially with respect to human health and disease. We have so many high-throughput methods for querying and learning about people and their diseases, and our ability to understand disease at a truly atomic resolution is unbelievable. We are on the cusp of many incredible new therapies for previously untreatable diseases. There are some downsides--I think science is very expensive and the amount of expertise needed is so great that a lot of the kind of romantic, smaller discoveries of the past are now accomplished by big teams with many specialized roles, but I think if you love science this is a great time to be alive! We know more than we've ever known and our ability to obtain knowledge has never been greater.\n\nI'm really curious about you, and your worldview, Adam. Can you tell me about yourself?",

For people who are under 40, the risk of dying from COVID is miniscule. This is not debatable.\n2) The vaccines do not significantly prevent getting COVID or spreading it.\n3) The potential risk from mRNA is completely unquantifiable.\n1) and 2) matter because the benefit for individuals as well as the population at large is not high in an absolute sense.\n3) matters because if the benefit of vaccination is not high - the risk of mRNA technology becomes significant.\nAnd this comes to the last point:\n4) immunologists do not have the right, the training or the mandate to make society wide choices. \nI have no problem trusting an immunologist to mostly get immune issues right.\nI have enormous problems with trusting immunologists to make societal tradeoffs.\nSo it isn't about aliens so much as asking your grocer to dictate your diet. \nYes, he works with food but that doesn't give him the right or the prerogative to dictate your dietary lifestyle.\nAnd the last point: I actually can see the point of vaccine mandates in those many countries where public health is a utility. The absolute number of people hospitalized/dying/dead is a direct impact on the government budget. From a bureaucratic standpoint, it is 100% understandable why they want vaccine mandates.\nThe problem is that none of those countries apply the same standard for smoking, for obesity, for freestyle mountain climbing, any number of other enormously risky behaviors which directly correlate to negative health outcomes and expense to public health care.\nThat's the real problem at hand.",

Though there remains a risk, though still low, of getting sick (which is bad) and maybe getting hospitalized (which is also very bad)! I guess you might say, \"well I don't care if I get sick, as long as I don't die, that's my business!\" And to that I might say, well where I live, hospitals are pretty packed and a lot of people can't get the care they need as quickly as they need it because too many people are in the hospital. \n\n2) The vaccines don't prevent getting COVID? I don't think they are 100% effective, but they reduce the risk of infection! Same with transmission, won't 100% prevent, but do reduce.\n\n3) I don't think the potential risk from mRNA is completely unquantifiable! At this point the mRNA vaccines have been given to hundreds of millions of people! Do you think that getting a vaccine might have effects many years down the road? Why?\n\n4) Where are immunologists making society wide decisions? Where I am from, we rely on elected officials to do that. I hope those officials are getting advice from people with specialized training, don't you?\n\nYour last point about smoking/obesity/other risky behaviors: I think there's a false equivalence between a government asking you to stop smoking, lose weight, or give up a hobby you love and get a vaccine Losing weight and quitting smoking are extremely difficult and require a lot of hard work, and I think people would bristle against a government forcing them to do something so difficult, even if it was beneficial in the long run. In contrast, getting the vaccine is a little inconvenient but is relatively low risk and has outsize impacts on maintaining a functioning healthcare system, which everyone needs.\n\nHope I was able to persuade you a bit!",

What are the percentages of these? \n\nThe first seems to have been shifting more and more as the marketing promise of the vaccine shifted, from (~100% effective to 95% to lower and lower until boosters are required, so on..). \n\nThe 2nd, well, I haven't really seen numbers quoted by any one studying the subject, of how much the vaccines really prevent transmissions. We thought before it could, now we know it doesn't stop it for sure, and guess it does by a bit. What is our best guess at how much viral load it inhibits or for overall people, stops transmission? 20% of viral load minimized? 30% less of people transmit virus? I'd love to see numbers, but my impression of this is the number is low, as data becomes more clear (it wasn't before).\n\nWith the transmission of viral load being unclear for a vaccinated person, why would I bother at all when the entire argument falls on \"prevent others from getting COVID, that's why you vaccinate selflessly\". However, everyone I know vaccinating is living life as normal: going to bars, gyms, gatherings with minimal mask use and minimal social distancing. Most aren't testing any longer. I test regularly, and do all of those things, so how am I transmitting COVID more often again? My intuitive hit is I probably transmit viral load a lot less than anyone vaccinated living life normally as was marketed to them per the main sale/reasons to return to normal behind the vaccine.",

            "body": "Scott-\n\nI appreciate the effort to use the ivermectin story as an opportunity to practice critically appraising the literature, but I think a ton is missing from this story.\n\n1) Several other comments have made this point, but there are a lot of scientific priors that should have created skepticism about ivermectin in the first place. We don't just randomly test medicines--we have to have some reason to believe they might work.  Ivermectin reportedly works on SARS COV2 by inhibiting viral entry into cells. However, the doses used in those petri dish studies aren't even close to those administered to COVID patients. More on this here: https://blogs.jwatch.org/hiv-id-observations/index.php/ivermectin-for-covid-19-breakthrough-treatment-or-hydroxychloroquine-redux/2021/01/04/\n\n2) The link I posted in (1) is from a very good blog written by the chief of infectious disease at the Brigham and Women's Hospital. If you give it a read, it's very hopeful about Ivermectin! It references some studies that have since been retracted. The reason I say this is that the medical establishment was excited about ivermectin when the small reports first started coming out (I am a critical care doctor and I was excited!). Unfortunately, none of it panned out. I would be VERY compelled by high quality evidence that ivermectin was helpful to patients, unfortunately even the largest RCT (Lopez-Medina) is pretty weak in many ways you discuss above.\n\n3) There's a huge incentive to tout the benefits of unproven treatments. Some of this is the \"epistemic minor league\" concept you talked about where people like feeling like they are \"in the know.\" Some of it is much simpler grift where individual physicians charge for consultations under the premise that they will give you ivermectin (For the low low price of $90, you can talk to a doctor who will prescribe ivermectin: https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ivermectin-demand-drives-trump-telemedicine-website-rcna1791). \n\n4) Sometimes I wish we could not fight about this. I often wish, as a practicing physician, that I could just say, \"well, ivermectin is, at worse, harmless (note this was not the case for hydroxychloroquine), so I'll just give it to someone who wants it, and otherwise treat them as I would have.\" Unfortunately, I have very rarely encountered a patient who was very interested in unproven treatments who is also willing to take medical advice. In general, it's \"give me ivermectin so I don't have to get the vaccine.\" This isn't limited to COVID--I have seen in play out in other diseases as well. \n\n5) I don't like the Austr-aliens metaphor. I think it gives people a little too much credit. I have had a patient say to me, \"I know you've saved my life before, but I am not getting the vaccine.\" I have told patients that I've gotten the vaccine. I have told them that I will give my children the vaccine, when they are eligible to get it. And they in general trust me very much! They have let me sedate them and look down their throat and into their lungs with a camera, let me stab them in the neck to push a tube down into their heart. They did not flinch or hesitate to let me do these invasive, risky things to them. I quoted a risk of DEATH with both procedures. I am not a scary alien from another planet. Many people who are not taking the vaccine have had their minds poisoned in a way that prevents them from acting according to their own lived values and preferences. \n\n6) I agree that shouting \"Trust Science\", or \"LOL HORSEPASTE\" is probably not the right way to go about convincing people who don't believe in evidence based medicine. However, I do think there are a lot of bad actors who, for personal gain, tout things like ivermectin, and hydroxychloroquine before that, and promote vaccine denialism. And while I think effective medical communication is something we badly need to understand better, it seems like the particular rhetorical tactics of the medical establishment matter much less than a political culture where a solid 40% of people are constantly receiving a message about distrusting expertise and authority. Once the meme that \"elites are hiding important information/misleading you\" takes hold, no matter how effective your communication strategy, you're going to have a very hard time reaching people, and unfortunately in this particular case it is a matter of life and death.",

You could get Dr. Kory and an immunologist from the CDC to collaborate on the study design and oversight, just to keep each other honest.\n\nBut instead all anybody who's interested in this question gets is abuse, from \"that's stupid/crazy\" to \"DON'T YOU DARE OR YOU WILL BE CAST OUT!!!!\" \n\nWTF?",

One is masklockdowns.squarespace.com. You'll have to go through each because it's not organized but a lot of links. The other is place I stumbled on called fearlesscanada.org. It's set up like a wiki. So for example, if you're interested in 'masks in hospital settings' there's a section on it. Heck, here's the link: https://fearlesscanada.org/mask-efficacy/ \n\nWhile I'm at it, I'm always on the hunt 'to be wrong'.

They looked at Covid infection and mortality rates in African countries that regularly dose their populations with Ivermectin vs. those that didn't and found a huge difference. \n\nThat could have been because the Ivermectin using populations were healthier due to fewer parasites, or it could have been effectiveness of Ivermectin against Covid. \n\nIn support of the latter, the infection and mortality rates in these countries were low for the entire world, not just vis a vis neighboring non-Ivermectin-using countries.\n\nIndia also seems to have gotten through Covid with very low mortality compared to the West, which they attribute to Ivermectin.\n\nThese nation-level trials would be much more telling than any clinical trials ever could be, just because of their magnitude, if they would just be properly studied, controlling for age demographics etcetera, something our CDC will never do.\n\nVerification of a safe and effective prophylactic would create \"vaccine hesitancy,\" which they have designated an evil to be fought at every turn. \n\nThat is why they never collected vaccine safety data for any statistically significant subgroup of vaccine recipients. If the vaccines were unsafe, they DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW. Such knowledge would tend to create \"vaccine hesitancy.\"\n\nSo all we have is anecdote through VAERS, and hospitals are systematically suppressing VAERS reporting on grounds that such reports could lead to \"vaccine hesitancy,\" which as per marching orders from the CDC, is to be avoided!\n\nThat's the story of that nurse practitioner who got fired because she was submitting the legally required VAERS reports for her hospital. The possibility that such reporting would contribute to vaccine hesitancy was against the mission of the hospital the director of the hospital told her in a phone call she recorded.\n\nWith proper study suppressed, it seems to me that our best indicators are still the national level trials, poorly analyzed as they are.",

But there are\n2: What are the effects of these \"vaccines\"?\nA: You can still die from Covid\nB: You can still end up in the ICU / Hospital because of Covid\nC: You can still be sick but not hospitalized because of Covid\nD: You can be asymptomatic for Covid, but still give it to other people\n\nLooks like the main thing the \"vaccines\" are good for is providing hosts where the Covid virus can mutate to make versions that do better against people who've had the \"vaccine\".\n\n3: I've seen a couple of charts comparing Covid vaccination rate for a US State to current Covid infection rates.  None of those charts have provided a solid \"more vaccinations == less cases\" line.  Do you have a graph that does?\n\n4: The CDC has been utterly dishonest in its promotion of the Covid shots.  See the KY study.\nIf fact, let's consider that study.  What's the data they claimed to have:\nA: List of every positive Covid test in KY\nB: List of every Covid shot given in KY\nC: Method to connect people in 1st group with people in the second group\n\nNow, let's all put on our scientist hats, and ask ourselves: What can I do with this data?\nHow about: \nCompare infection rates of people who haven't had Covid, but have had the shot, to those who've had Covid, and not had the shot?\n\nWhat is the one test they do not admit having done?  Why, that one.\nDespite having a press release who's headline states they were looking at protection from having been infected vs protection from having had the shot.\n\nSo, what are the numbers of people involved?\nWell, as of May 1 there were > 1.4 million people in KY who'd been \"fully vaccinated\".  There were > 600 thousand who'd had Covid.\n\nHow many people did they look at?\n738\n246 people who were \"repeat infection\", i.e. \"case patients\", and 492 not infected who they looked at, and called \"controls\"\n\nWhy yes, that's right.  They had 600,000+ people to compare against, and they decided to only look at 492 of them\n\nOr, rather, the results they reported only looked at 492 of them.\n\nAnyone out there really believe they didn't try a 1 to 20, or 1 to 200 comparison, not just the 1 to 2 they reported?\n\nAnyone there have access to the data behind this \"study\", so that someone who's not utterly dishonest can look at it?\n\nI got the shot back in April, because I thought the science behind it was great, and I was looking forward to kissing the masks, the lockdowns, teh social distancing, and all that other BS goodbye.\n\nI'm now disappointed that the mRNA vaccine technology is apparently not yet ready for prime time, and that the people currently pushing the shots are, to use your example, the aliens telling us to get brain implants.\n\nGiven the blatant dishonesty coming out of the CDC, I don't see how any other position can be considered rational.",

People are terrible at assessing risk, now more than ever. It sucks that a lot of those people have political power, but I'm not going to update my beliefs on the vaccine because some moron who got elected to school board thinks my kids should have to wear masks until they're 40. \n\nI don't know what the \"KY study\" is but here's Wisconsin's data, which I just saw on Twitter the other day, comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated risk in what to me seems like a very straightforward way: https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/vaccine-status.htm",

They're actual vaccines! We've called far less effective vaccines vaccines, and did it before the aliens landed or whatever your analogy is. You, in this specific case, are the alien landing on earth and making stuff up.\n\nAnyway, I'm not suggesting I know the vaccines work because I personally am well, I'm suggesting that the preponderance of evidence is that they work very well + I'm a healthy 35-year-old so COVID isn't a big deal for me anyway. (I was in fact completely willing in March 2020 to have someone infect me with it so I could work in public and keep the economy from collapsing, and then later signed up with that group who tried to agitate for challenge trials. Didn't come to that, but I believe you're arguing with a version of me that doesn't exist.)\n\nThe mistake I think you're making repeatedly here is using someone's flimsy evidence or stupid behavior to dismiss entirely a proposition whose truth or untruth is not dependent on whatever stupid person you hate being right. I agree with you‚Äîmask mandates for vaccinated people are stupid! They're stupid because the vaccines work. People implement them because they are obsessed with the appearance of safety, because they are coded the right way in the culture wars, because it owns the conservatives, whatever bad motive you want to impute. They don't implement them because they have special knowledge about the actual effectiveness of the vaccines. \n\nLIkewise, I would probably be fine with people being allowed to get antibody tests and be declared \"vaccinated.\" Not my world, unfortunately, so people will have to deal with getting the COVID vaccine. It's safer than driving to the grocery store, so no big deal! \n\nThat said, I don't think that's the big own you believe it to be in the Wisconsin data, since a not-insignificant portion of the people in that Wisconsin October 2021 data who are not vaccinated have already had COVID. If the data were split out the way you like would it be that vaccinated people are even less likely to get COVID, get sick from it, or die from it relative to immunologically naive people than they are in the existing chart? And if that's the case, wouldn't an immunologically naive person be making a totally sound decision to get the vaccine, even if a person who's had COVID already can take it or leave it? \n\nDo you have any population-level data like this that does support your point? Your method of refutation here seems to be just taking big piles of data that don't support it and throwing all of them out because they don't contain the precise split that could falsify a very specific version of your premise. \n\n(With your claim about mutations you're not even doing that‚ÄîAlpha and Delta both emerged in mid-late 2020, so vaccines literally could not be responsible for them. Surely it's possible someone with the vaccine will be patient zero for a future mutation that outcompetes Delta, but even then, given that the score is currently 2-0 unvaccinated, you won't have evidence your theory is true. It seems obvious to me that vaccinating immunocompromised people who are unable to fight off COVID infections‚Äîwhich is one theory for how Alpha emerged‚Äîwould be better than letting them get a natural infection with no defense at all, seeing as the point is their natural, unprimed defenses CAN'T suppress the virus by themselves.)

Countries with highest vaxxed percentages are seeing higher death RATES for fully-vaxxed than for unvaxxed (see latest UK and Israeli numbers). They keep much better, more granular data than the U.S. does.\n\nSafe? More deaths and permanent injuries in 9 months than the overall total for ALL vaccines since the beginning of record-keeping (30 years or so). And that just scratches the surface--nor does it count the even worse results in the EU's ECDC Covid vaccine tracking system.\n\nDang.

Here's an article with UK data from September and October showing that unvaccinated people in a given age group are much more likely to die from COVID than their vaccinated counterparts (look for \"COVID-19 deaths (a) within 28 days and (b) within 60 days of positive specimen or with COVID-19 reported on death certificate, by vaccination status between week 37 and week 40 2021\"): https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/22/4-charts-show-how-covid-vaccines-are-working-in-the-uk-.html\n\nThere's also this release from the UK government earlier this month, which combines all the data into an \"age-standardized mortality rate\": https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19byvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween2januaryand24september2021\n\nYou can find basically the same thing in Israel, only I don't read Hebrew and Google is very bad at auto-translating it on an interactive website. \n\nGiven the obvious selection biases at work in COVID vaccination‚Äîold and sick people are way more likely to be vaccinated, for obvious reasons‚ÄîI can think of no good-faith reason to just use raw population-wide mortality for a disease where the risk of death is so age-stratified.",

            "body": "Once I had an argument with an intelligent and smart conspiracy theorist. Specifically we were talking about the Jewish conspiracy, but as it happens, it was connected to all the other stuff like GMO food and LGBT \"propaganda\". We managed to find something like a crux of our disagreement. When I presented him an idea of following the most evidience he strictly disagreed. He claimed that obviously the most evidience was fraudulent and I was very naive to trust it. \n\nI tried to explain how it's an opposite of naivity. How it's easier to fraud the minority of evidience then the majority. How a successfull conspiracy is less likely than an attempt to create a conspiracy. So it's more likely that the minority of people who are claiming that GMO is dangerous, are trying to create there own conspiracy to profit from the organic food, for example, rather than revealing an existent conspiracy created to profit from GMO food. This point he seemed to accept to some degree. But still what if we are in a less likely world? It is still possible, right, however it seems unlikely. And what if our own ability to judge the probabilities is affected by the conspiracy? What's then?\n\nAnd I still have only one answer to this. Then, we have already lost. Just like that. In a world with a successfull conspiracy we have already lost. In a world where aliens have already infiltrated our society and installed their brain implants which make us discard the possibility of overlordship we have already lost. Species with anti-occamian and anti-laplacian priors are hopelessly lost in our universe and it would be a cruelest joke if anybody ever design them. That's terrifying, I agree. And this terror is the price we pay for winning in the worlds where such conspiracies are only attempting to happen, where our maps corresponds to the territiory enough so that accuring knowledge is possible in principle.\n\nWhen it comes to trusting the scientific consensus, I think it's important to remind ourself that science does produce most and best evidience for our civilization. And yes, sometimes it's wrong. Sometimes embarassingly so. And when it happens trusting it will lead us astray. But that's the price we pay for winning in all the other situations when scientific consensus is right and, what's important, winning effortlessly. When we are trying to guess the colour of a card from a deck where 70% is red - guessing red in 100% of the time is the optimal strategy, unless you have some more insights about the deck and cards order. And yes, we will be wrong in 30% of cases. But that's the price we pay for being right in 70%.\n\nIf we do have some insights about the deck, though...  Then we can do better. We can create some strategy that will allow us to improve over the baseline. And that where \"doing your own research\" come in play. It has some apportunity costs, if you have to spend 10 years of your life in prison to improve your card guessing score by 1% it probably doesn't worth it. Sometimes, though, there are more low hanging fruits or the profit you can extract from being a little more correct than others is worth it. Sometimes it's not even about probability estimates but about cost benefit analysis. Sometimes we are dealing with such a civilizational inadequacy that even a couple of hours of your own research can let you beat the experts.\n\nThe problem, however, is that most of the people who claim to do their own research are not actually improving the baseline of simply trusting the scientific consensus. They do not posses any special knowledge about the deck and do not have means to accure it. In the best case they just reaffirm what scientific consensus tells. In the worst - they start claiming that all the established science is completely wrong and guess black every time. Not only they spend their time and efforts, they do significantly worse, discarding our best tool in favour of worse ones.\n\nBut if all the established science is wrong we have already lost. If deceptive aliens have already infiltrated our society and control our epistemology itself, then there is no winning strategy. This scenario doesn't even worth considering.",
